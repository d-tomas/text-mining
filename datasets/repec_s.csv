"Alan V. Deardorff","Post-Doha Trade Policy Options for a Small Country","This paper uses a partial equilibrium model of two small countries, within a large worldeconomy, implementing reciprocal tariff cuts on each otherÕs exports in a regional tradeagreement (RTA) and compares the effects with unilateral most-favored-nation (MFN) tariffcuts. The reciprocal cuts are shown to be more likely beneficial to a country the larger is thepartner countryÕs trade. The welfare effects of a countryÕs own tariff cut on imports are alsocompared to the effects on its welfare of the partner-countryÕs tariff cut on its exports. If tarifflevels are low, the latter is seen to be larger than the former. Implications of the analysis are that,if multilateral trade liberalization is unlikely, then small countries should seek to form RTAswith countries larger than themselves. In addition, to assure that they have something to offer insuch arrangements, they should not go too far in unilaterally reducing their MFN tariffs.",F
"Alan V. Deardorff","What Do We (and Others) Mean by The Terms of Trade?","I explore how the concept of Òthe terms of tradeÓ has been used since it was coined by Marshall.  Early writers (Taussig, Viner, Dorrance) constructed variations on the relative price of traded goods that Marshall was concerned with, but most of these variations have been left behind in modern uses of the term, which today almost always refer to a relative price of exports and imports.  However, when authors have wanted to identify the terms of trade with a particular country and to represent it either symbolically in an economic model or empirically, they have had to choose between defining the terms of trade as the relative price of exports or the relative price of imports.  The first to do this was Taussig, who chose the second option, but he was followed by Viner who chose the first, and was followed in this choice by almost all writers for the next several decades.  Then, around 1980, TaussigÕs choice came back into fashion among scholars of international finance.  I document this contrast in definitions between international trade and international finance, then add slightly to VinerÕs argument for preferring that the terms of trade of a country be defined as the relative price of its exports.",F

Hymans|Robert M Stern|Chong Xiang","Forecasting U.S. Trade in Services","This paper provides a set of forecasts of United States international trade in services, both at the aggregate level and for four subcategories. These sectors are: travel, which is mostly tourist expenditures; passenger fares, which is mostly passenger air transportation; transportation, other than passenger transportation; and other private services, including education, financial services, insurance, telecommunications, and business, professional and technical services. A forecasting model is constructed and estimated, based on conventional economic forces of supply and demand, dependent on cost variables and income variables as well as relative prices. For forecasting purposes, these variables are taken from the Michigan Quarterly Econometric Model of the U.S. Economy, a macroeconomic forecasting model with forecasts provided regularly by the University of Michigan Research Seminar in Quantitative Economics.",F
"Alan V. Deardorff","Economic Effects of 'Leveling the Playing Field' in International Trade","This paper uses simple economic theory to examine the effects of various policies that are intended to level the playing field in international trade. That is, when foreign producers are given advantages over domestic producers by government subsidies or other interventions that lower their costs, domestic firms may argue that their own governments should either provide comparable assistance or should protect them from competing with the foreign firms on grounds of fairness. Economic analysis easily shows that granting these requests is usually harmful for the domestic economy as a whole, but that may not prevent such policies from being implemented. Therefore this paper examines what the further effects of such policies may be. The main conclusion that emerges is that policies to level the playing field most often overcompensate those who request them, making them better off than if the playing field had not be tilted against them in the first place.",F

"Dukgeun Ahn|Jieun Lee","Countervailing Duty against China:  Opening a Pandoraâs Box in the WTO System?","In this paper, we trace the jurisprudential history of the applicability of US countervailing duty (CVD)law to non-market economies (NMEs). We describe how, since the United States reversed its longstanding policy of not imposing CVDs on NMEs, concurrent application of antidumping (AD) andcountervailing duties has become the country's major trade remedy action against China. Although theWTO panel rejected China's claim of WTO-inconsistency regarding the current US practices, the USCourt of International Trade firmly ruled that the Department of Commerce's double counting of AD andCVD against China violates domestic regulation. Finally, the WTO Appellate Body ruled that this'double remedy' violates the rule to levy CVDs 'in the appropriate amounts' under Article 19.3 of theSCM Agreement. We will argue that, although the Appellate Body's ruling is praiseworthy in preventingan illogical practice, its legal reasoning may give rise to some doubts and controversy when thenegotiating history of Article 19 is examined. We will also analyze key features of current double remedypractices in the United States and Canada.",F
"Alan V. Deardorff","Trade Implications of the Trans-Pacific Partnership for ASEAN and Other Asian Countries","The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) aspires to become a state-of-the-art trade agreement linking 12 countries on both sides of the Pacific. In addition to establishing a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) among these countries, negotiators are pursuing a long list of other issues, both trade-related and non-trade related. This paper examines the likely effects of the TPP on trade alone, taking into account the fact that all of the potential members of the TPP are already participants in other FTAs. Using information from the World Trade Organization on the existence of these FTAs, plus data on the identities of countriesÕ major trading partners for both exports and imports, I discuss the likely effects on a list of countries in terms of trade creation, trade diversion, and the reversal of trade diversion that has already occurred due to existing FTAs. The list of countries includes all of the members of the TPP as well as of ASEAN. In addition it includes ten additional Asian economies that are not part of either.",F
"Alan V. Deardorff|Jee-Hyeong Park","A Story of Trade-Induced Industrialization","We offer a simple variant of the standard Heckscher-Ohlin Model thatexplains how a developing country, by opening to trade with a large capital-abundanteconomy, can be induced to shift resources into more capital-intensiveproduction than what it was producing in autarky. As a result it experiences arise in its return to capital and, if capital is internationally mobile, both anincrease in its capital stock and an increase in trade. These results arise in amodel in which both a traditional and a modern sector can produce final goodsthat are perfect substitutes. The modern sector uses intermediate inputs thatdiffer in their relative capital intensities, while being both more capital intensivethan the traditional sector. The results of this model accord well with theexperience of the Asian Tiger economies during the early decades of theirexport-oriented industrialization.",F
"Lincoln, William F.|McCallum, Andrew H.","Entry Costs and Increasing Trade","Using confidential microdata from the US Census, we find that the fraction of manufacturing plants that export rose from 21% in 1987 to 39% in 2006. It has been suggested that similar trends in other countries may have been caused by declining costs of entering foreign markets. Our study tests this hypothesis for the first time. Both reduced form and structural estimation approaches find little evidence that the entry costs declined significantly in the US over this period. We instead argue that changes in other factors that determine export status are sufficient to explain these trends.",F

"Steve Machin|Shqiponja Telhaj|Joan Wilson","The mobility of English school children","In this paper, we examine links between pupil mobility and pupil and school characteristics at all levels of compulsory schooling in England. We derive measures of mobility from two academic years of the Pupil Level Annual School Census (PLASC) data, a unique national administrative pupil-level longitudinal data source. Our findings suggest that mobile pupils are more socially disadvantaged than non-mobile pupils and are significantly less likely to have a good prior education record. Moreover, we find that pupils are less likely to move if the school they attend has good average performance levels. Finally, when children move school, they are more likely to end up in a school with better Key Stage performance than the one they left, but this improvement is significantly more marked for children from better-off backgrounds.",I

There has been no proper statement about this from the government, so the paper is an attempt to make explicit what is latent in the reforms. It does this partly historically by looking at ideas of citizenship that have been presupposed in the development of the British Welfare State. It is claimed that there are two rather different approaches to be discerned: one sees citizenship as a basic status, which in turn is the basis of entitlement; the other view is that citizenship is something that has to be developed or achieved, typically by participation in the labour market and by discharging obligations. This distinction is then used more analytically to assess some of the welfare reforms and to indicate possible sources of future difficulty and tension in so far as the government embraces the obligation-oriented view of citizenship.",I

Social Security Policy and Public Attitudes Since 1997","This paper examines New Labour's social security and related policies since 1997 in the light of evidence on public attitudes. The list of measures where policies have been in or have come into line with public attitudes is much longer than the list of measures where policies have been out of line with public attitudes or appear to have led them. One interpretation is that policy has been led by opinion surveys and focus groups, with opportunities lost to take more radical action and then persuade people of the need and justification for it. An alternative would be that policy has navigated with the grain of some of the more progressive parts of public opinion to achieve a result that has carried the public with it, in a way that would not have been sustainable if there had simply been an increase in the generosity of an unreformed social security system.",I

If individuals select into smoking according to some unobserved health characteristic, then estimates of the effect of tobacco on health that do not account for this are biased. We show that using information on mortality, morbidity and smoking, it is possible to control for this selection effect and obtain consistent estimates of the effect of smoking on mortality. We implement our method on Swedish data. We show that there is selection into smoking, and considerable dispersion around the average effect, so that health policies that aim at decreasing smoking prevalence and quantities smoked might have less effect in terms of average number of years of life gained than previously estimated. We also empirically show that selection into smoking has increased over the last fifty years with the availability of information on the dangers of smoking, so that future studies comparing smokers and non smokers will spuriously reveal a worsening effect of tobacco on health if they fail to control for selection.",I

While this is true virtually everywhere, this SES gradient is noticeably higher in Ireland compared to other OECD countries despite much effort in recent decades to address this inequality. This study evaluates a university access program in Ireland that provides financial, academic and social support to low SES students both prior to and after entry to university. It uses a natural experiment involving the gradual roll-out of the program to identify the effect of the program. The program has parallels with US Affirmative Action programs, although preferential treatment in this case is based on SES rather than ethnicity. Evaluating the effectiveness of programs targeting disadvantaged students in Ireland is particularly salient given the high rate of return to education and the lack of intergenerational mobility in educational attainment. Overall, we find positive treatment effects on first year exam performance, progression to second year and final year graduation rates, with the impact often stronger for higher ability students. We find similar patterns of results for students that entered through the regular system and the 'affirmative action' group i.e. the students that entering with lower high school grades. The program affects both male and female students, albeit in different ways. The study is unable to identify which specific component of the treatment is responsible for the effects but we find no evidence that changes in the financial support have an effect on student outcomes. This study suggests that access programs can be an effective means of improving academic outcomes for socio-economically disadvantaged students. </p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></p>",I

To remain close to theory I focus on changes in firms' organisational and industrial structure driven by plant closures. As predicted by models of vertical multinationals I find that investment in relatively low-wage economies is associated with plant closures in relatively low-skill, labour-intensive industries in the UK. The findings are of interest in the context of the relaxation of barriers to inward investment in low-wage economies.</p>",F

Several new firm-level models of international trade with heterogeneous firms predict that industry productivity will rise as trade costs fall due to the reallocation of activity across plants within an industry. Using disaggregated U.S. import data, we create a new measure of trade costs over time and industries. As the models predict, productivity growth is faster in industries with falling trade costs. We also find evidence supporting the major hypotheses of the heterogenous- firm models. Plants in industries with falling trade costs are more likely to die or become exporters. Existing exporters increase their shipments abroad. The results do not apply equally across all sectors but are strongest for industries most likely to be producing horizontally-differentiated tradeable goods.",F

Para ello se han estimado para cada uno de los paÃ­ses de la UEM una funciÃ³n de demanda de exportaciÃ³n de manufacturas totales, es decir, incluyendo la demanda proveniente de los demÃ¡s paÃ­ses de la zona euro y del resto del mundo, con datos trimestrales procedentes de la OCDE correspondientes al perÃ­odo 1975 2002. Las elasticidades obtenidas en las estimaciones difieren mucho entre paÃ­ses, tanto en relaciÃ³n con los precios como con la renta. En particular, se observa que la elasticidad de las exportaciones frente a los mercados de exportaciÃ³n es mÃ¡s elevada en aquellos paÃ­ses que partÃ­an de una posiciÃ³n econÃ³mica menos avanzada y que, a lo largo del perÃ­odo, han registrado un rÃ¡pido proceso de integraciÃ³n en los mercados internacionales de bienes. Las distintas elasticidades precio de largo plazo parecen venir explicadas, en tÃ©rminos generales, por la distinta composiciÃ³n de las exportaciones, aunque en algunos casos, aspectos idiosincrÃ¡sicos pueden ser relevantes para justificar ciertos valores. En el corto plazo resultan mÃ¡s importantes y mÃ¡s inmediatos los efectos sobre las exportaciones de la variable de renta que los de la competitividad.",F

We next use our network-based community measure as a predictor of additional countries chosen by firms expanding their export destinations portfolios. Using data on new Mexican exporters, the probability of choosing a new export destination doubles  if it belongs to the same community of any of the firmâs previous destinations. The introduction of the network-based community variable improves the accuracy of the model by up to 19% relative to a model that only includes gravity variables.

This paper develops a dynamic general equilibrium model to analyse the effect on interest rates, asset prices, investment, consumption, output, the exchange rate and the current account of a shift in portfolio preferences of foreign investors. The model has two countries and two asset classes (equities and bonds). It is characterised by imperfect substitutability between assets and allows for endogenous adjustment in interest rates and asset prices. Therefore, it accounts for capital gains arising from equity price movements, in addition to valuation effects caused by changes in the exchange rate. To illustrate the mechanics of the model, we calibrate it to analyse the consequences of an increase in the importance of sovereign wealth funds (SWFs). Specifically, we ask what would happen if âexcessâ reserves held by emerging markets were transferred from central banks to SWFs. We look separately at two diversification paths: one in which SWFs keep the same allocation across bonds and equities as central banks, but move away from dollar assets (path 1); and another in which they choose the same currency composition as central banks, but shift from US bonds to US equities (path 2). In path 1, the dollar depreciates and US net debt falls on impact and increases in the long run. In path 2, the dollar depreciates and US net debt increases in the long run. In both cases, there is a reduction in the âexorbitant privilegeâ, ie, the excess return the United States receives on its assets over what it pays on its liabilities. The model is applicable to other episodes in which foreign investors change the composition of their portfolios.",F

"Mabel SÃ¡nchez-Barrioluengo","Expenditure on education in Purchasing Power Standards: A comparison of three alternative deflators","Following the conclusions of the IEG Indicator Expert Group on Education Expenditure the main recommended indicator to compare expenditure on education across countries is based on the expenditure per capita (students in full time equivalent âFTE) and corrected using purchasing power parities (PPP) as convertor unit. The election of PPP is based on its two main characteristics: a) it is a currency convertor able to transform different currencies to a common currency; and b) it is a spatial price deflator, that is, it equalizes purchasing power eliminating differences in price levels. However, different approaches could be used to calculate PPP in order to standardized expenditure values (Eurostat-OECD, 2012): PPP in GDP, PPP in actual individual consumption (AIC) and PPP in actual individual consumption of education (AICE). This report focueses on a) the comparison of the basket elements of goods and services of the three deflators, b) the analysis of the evolution of education expenditures per student in purchasing power standards (PPS) across Member States (MS) at different levels; and c) the assessment of the quality adjustment factor included in the PPP Education based on PISA scores. Results suggests that the selection of the deflator matters when purchasing power parities are used in international expenditure comparison. In particular, while PPP in GDP is the traditional deflator used, PPP in AIC provides a better measure of economic activity for comparisons of material well-being of household. However the application of PPP Education needs additional investigation because its application significantly changes the expenditure distribution picture of EU MS. On the other hand, the inclusion or exclusion of the quality-adjustment (measure through PISA scores) to calculate PPP Education does not change the relative position of the EU MS in the expenditure distribution, but it is a recommended approximation to control for the different qualities of education outputs.",I

"Michail Batikas|Estrella Gomez Herrera|Bertin Martens","Film availability in Netflix country stores in the EU","This study compares the film catalogues among the 11 Netflix country stores in the EU that provide film streaming services to consumers on the basis of a subscription (SVOD) business model. We estimate cross-border availability of films in Netflix in the EU at 31%, somewhat lower than the 40% availability of downloadable films in the Apple iTunes stores in the EU. Availability patterns are to a large extent driven by consumer preferences and geographical and linguistic proximity. The average delay in availability between theatre and Netflix release (windowing) in the EU11 is 326 days, with wide variations across countries, compared to only 112 days delay in the US. Windowing delays are shortening for more recent films. For a sample of films in the UK Netflix catalogue we find that they remain available for 340 days on average.",F
"Georgios Alaveras|Estrella Gomez Herrera|Bertin Martens","Market fragmentation in Video-on-Demand Services in the EU28","The main objective of the present study is to measure the extent of market segmentation for video-on-demand (VoD) services in the EU. We examine access to VoD catalogues in other countries and compare the content of film catalogue available across countries.  Using various sources of data on VoD services we find that cross-border access to VoD services in the EU28 is extremely limited at 1.9% of available VoD services in the EU. Cross-border availability of film titles reaches 16.8%. Netflix performs better with 31% cross-border availability. Cross-border availability in VoD catalogues remains far below the 40% availability observed in digital film downloads, 80% in digital music downloads and 93% in e-books catalogues.  Even within EU Member States, the VoD market is very fragmented with catalogue overlaps between local VoD providers in the order of 30-50% only.  Consumers incur high switching costs to access a wider variety of products in this segmented market.",F

"Cristiano Codagnone|Bertin Martens","Scoping the Sharing Economy: Origins, Definitions, Impact and Regulatory Issues","This report selectively draws on the systematic review of a large set of data sources, which is presented elsewhere, and comprises 430 secondary sources (Codagnone, 2016). The report also provides a critical overview of key analytical, empirical, and normative dimensions of the sharing economy. It reviews both the rhetorical and controversial debates currently surrounding the topics and the available empirical evidence in order to sharpen our understanding of relevant policy and regulatory issues. The broad umbrella term 'sharing economy' is critically assessed and a typology developed that identifies the commercial 'peer to peer' sharing economy as the main focus of both controversies and policy-relevant issues. Empirical evidence of the benefits and costs of the sharing economy and its implications for sustainability and employment is very limited and inconclusive, particularly as regards the European landscape. This critical review, hence, shows that, as yet, there are no unambiguous answers to some of the fundamental questions about the sharing economy. The available research is too limited and patchy to give us a comprehensive and coherent picture. This reports main contribution is to clear some of the conceptual and empirical fog around the sharing economy and to identify where possible answers might be found in the future. It is suggested that the definition of sharing platforms should focus on P2P activities, as most of the policy concerns are found there. These include regulatory and consumer protection issues resulting from the informal production of services, potentially unfair competition with formal B2C service providers, and questions related to dominance and market power of P2P platform operators as commercial businesses.",F
"Georgios Alaveras|Estrella Gomez Herrera|Bertin Martens","Geographic Fragmentation in the EU Market for e-Books: The case of Amazon","This study examines geographical market segmentation in the market for e-books in the EU, based on data from the Amazon Kindle e-books store, the market leader. Residents in all EU countries have access to the Amazon US Kindle store. However, access to Amazon's 6 e-book stores in the EU (UK, Germany, France, Spain, Italy and the Netherlands) is restricted to residents in each of these countries and in 4 neighbouring countries with which they share a language. There is no cross-border store access between these 6 countries. Because e-book catalogues are 93% overlapping between these 6 stores, cross-border access restrictions do not significantly affect cross-border availability in the EU6+4=EU10. Even for the remaining EU18 cross-border availability is very high because they have access to nearly all e-books in the EU6 stores via the Amazon US store. They have no direct access to the EU6 e-book stores however. Lifting digital access walls for Amazon e-book stores in the EU would result in a small increase only in the book titles available to EU consumers.",F

Unlike previous studies that employ a similar approach, I consider a large eight variable vector autoregressive system that includes short term interest rates rather than money stocks in order to help identify monetary policy shocks. Results for the U.S. and the U.K. show that monetary policy shocks and other macroeconomic shocks behave according to theory. However, monetary shocks account for only a small fraction of the variance of the real exchange rate. Instead, âtaste shocksâ that can be associated with the degree of trade openness, terms of trade, and current account appear to be the key factor driving the U.S.-U.K. real exchange rate. Results for other countries under consideration (Canada, Germany, and Japan) are similar.",F
"Abigail S. Hornstein|Minyuan Zhao|Abigail S.

The case of China is useful for understanding this problem because there is substantial time series and cross sectional variation in the ratio of utilized to contracted FDI (UC ratio), which is less than one in most province-year observations. Provinces may believe that they are rewarded for reporting higher levels of contracted FDI, which would lead to lower UC ratios and higher policy incentives in subsequent years. Alternatively, provinces may be rewarded for reporting data more accurately, which would lead to higher UC ratios and policy incentives in subsequent years. Empirical analysis supports the second, institutional theory and suggests that provinces may increase their rate of utilizing pledged FDI by strengthening their legal systems and reducing government bureaucracy.",F

Evidence for European Global Systemically Important Banks","Large banks were largely blamed for the recent financial crisis, due to their roles in the propagation of the crisis. Partly due to the unprecedented amount of public funds disbursed to rescue the fail banks to avert the total breakdown of the global financial system and the resultant moral hazard of their bailout. Policymakers and regulators have significantly increased bank regulations after the crisis to rein-in some of the excesses of the banks that cause to the financial crisis. Particularly, Basel III capital regulation came into existence largely to strengthening the capital framework for banks and increases the loss absorbency for the so-called too big to fail banks. This study investigates the impact of capital regulation on the capital and risk portfolio behaviour of European large and complex banks during the period 20092014. By using a modified version of the structural equation model developed by Shrieves and Dahl (1992) to estimate the effect of capital regulation on banks capital and risk portfolios decisions. The findings of our model estimation indicate that regulation has a significant impact on changes in bank capital. We, however, do not find any significant evidence of the impact of regulation on bank risk portfolio decisions. Model estimation results also show that there is a significant negative relationship between changes in bank capital level and changes in risk portfolio level and vice versa.",M

El objetivo del presente estudio consiste en proponer un modelo integrador que explore las posibles relaciones entre los antecedentes de comportamiento más explorados hasta la fecha, a fin de determinar la relevancia real de todos ellos a la hora de configurar las intenciones de compra del consumidor. Con este objetivo en mente, se propone un modelo causal para entender las intenciones de compra de productos de comercio justo a partir de la orientación social del consumidor, su percepción sobre las organizaciones comercializadoras y los propios productos, y la actitud hacia la marca genérica. El modelo se testa empíricamente con datos recabados de una muestra de 292 consumidores españoles. Los resultados muestran que la orientación social del consumidor tiene el mayor efecto sobre las intenciones de compra, por encima de las características de los propios productos, la imagen de las organizaciones comercializadoras y la actitud del consumidor hacia la marca. De hecho, la actitud hacia la marca no tiene efecto significativo sobre las intenciones de compra del consumidor.",M

"Álvaro Garrido Morgado|Oscar González Benito|Mercedes Martos Partal","Influencia de la calidad percibida del producto en la efectividad de diferentes estímulos comerciales: presentaciones especiales en el establecimiento & folletos publicitarios","Este estudio se centra en analizar la efectividad de dos estímulos comerciales diferentes: las presentaciones especiales del producto (técnicas de merchandising) y los folletos publicitarios. Mientras que las presentaciones especiales del producto tienen lugar en el interior del establecimiento provocando una decisión de compra más inmediata e impulsiva, los folletos publicitarios funcionan principalmente en el exterior del establecimiento y, por tanto, favorecen una decisión de compra más razonada. Se utiliza la teoría de las señales que distingue entre dos dimensiones de calidad percibida, la calidad extrínseca relacionada a la marca- y la calidad intrínseca relacionada a las características internas del producto-, para analizar el papel que juega la percepción de calidad a la hora de determinar la efectividad de ambos estímulos comerciales en la venta de productos con una alta implicación de compra y riesgo percibido. El análisis empírico se centra en los productos informáticos que comercializa uno de los mayores distribuidores especializados en Europa y combina datos de escáner sobre las ventas, datos de observación sobre la utilización de los estímulos comerciales y datos de encuesta sobre la calidad percibida por los consumidores. Los resultados muestran que ambas dimensiones de calidad percibida matizan la influencia de las presentaciones especiales y de los folletos publicitarios sobre las ventas, aunque su impacto es diferente en cada uno de los estímulos comerciales. La calidad percibida extrínseca aumenta en mayor medida la efectividad de las presentaciones especiales, las cuales están relacionadas con compras no planificadas. En cambio, la calidad percibida intrínseca mejora en mayor medida el efecto de los folletos publicitarios, los cuales están más relacionados con las compras planificadas.",M
"Ángel Herrero Crespo|Héctor San Martín Gutiérrez|Mª del Mar García de los Salmones Sánchez|Jesús Collado Agudo","Brand equity of tourism destinations: The influence of country image and regional image","This paper focuses on the customer-based brand equity for a regional tourist destination, and develops a theoretical model including the causal relationships between the dimensions of brand equity (awareness, image, perceived quality and loyalty). Accordingly, the loyalty of international tourists is considered as the main outcome variable for explanation in the theoretical model. Moreover, the paper adopts an international tourism approach and takes into account the hierarchy of destination brands, analyzing the influence of country destination image (i.e. country as umbrella brand) on the regional destination image. The empirical evidence obtained from a sample of 253 international tourists visiting a regional destination in Spain supports that loyalty towards the destination is positively influenced by the perceived quality of the destination, which in turn is directly influenced by the image and awareness of the destination. Additionally, our results support for the idea that the perceptions of international tourists of a regional destination are positively influenced by their perceptions of the country destination where the region is located. The countrys brand therefore acts as an umbrella brand for the regions brand.",M

Large Lessons for Europe from a Three-asset-portfolio Model","The paper develops a three-asset-portfolio model to analyse consequences of foreign exchange market operations by Asian central banks on the exchange rates between euro, dollar and an Asian currency. It is found that - contrary to public belief - the purchase of dollar assets by Asian central banks strengthens the dollar against both the euro and the Asian currency. A diversification of Asian central bank reserves from dollar into euro would weaken the dollar against both other currencies. Thus, such a diversification would be incompatible with Asian currency pegs. However, it is shown that Asian central banks could alter their relative portfolio composition while keeping the peg intact if they shifted from intervening against the dollar into intervening against the euro.",F

Investments in further education depend on contextual factors, i.e. the companys investment in mate-rial and immaterial assets, its labour relations and its staff structure. The empirical analysis was conducted based on data from the IAB establishment panel. The findings of probit and tobit estimates confirmed the theoretical results, whereas only a few variables were significant, if OLS estimates (for companies participating in further training) were used. This indicates that the decisions on the participation in further training and the intensity thereof are taken simultaneously. Therefore a one-phase estimate is most suit-able.",I

By including personality measures in the 2005 survey, SOEP becomes the first available dataset to provide long term evidence about personality, life events and change in one key measure of SWB, namely life satisfaction. Using these data, the paper suggests a major revision to the set-point or dynamic equilibrium theory of SWB in order to account for long term change.",I
"Stefan Felder|Andreas Werblow","A Physician Fee that Applies to Acute but not to Preventive Care: Evidence from a German Deductible Program","A certain German sickness fund offers 240 per year to its clients if they pay the first 300 of their health care bills, except for physician visits, for which a flat rate of 20 applies. This paper studies the effects of this deductible scheme on health care demand by comparing about 5,000 participants with a control sample, using the sickness funds claims data covering in-patient care, prescription drugs, and ambulatory care. The data extend to three years: the year of the start of the program and the two years preceding this. We apply a parametric approach that models the choice of the deductible program, the probability of positive expenses as well as the demand for health care services, conditional on demand being positive. Instruments for the participation decision are used, and the results are compared with those of an exogenous specification of the program choice. The physician fee appears to significantly decrease the number of visits as well as the expenses for curative care. By contrast, prevention activities, not subject to the co-payment, remain constant.",I
"Ulrich Schimmack","Measuring Wellbeing in the SOEP","I define wellbeing as preference realization. Wellbeing can be measured with affective (the amount of pleasant versus unpleasant experiences) and cognitive (satisfaction with life in general and life domains) measures. Since its inception 25 years ago, the SOEP has included cognitive measures of wellbeing. In 2007, the SOEP included four items (happy, sad, angry, afraid) as an affective measure of wellbeing. This paper examines similarities and differences between cognitive and affective measures of wellbeing. In the end, I propose a wellbeing index that combines information from measures of life satisfaction, average domain satisfaction and affect balance.",I
"Hendrik Jürges","Health Insurance Status and Physician Behavior in Germany","Germany has a two-tier system of statutory and primary private health insurance. Both insurance types provide fee-for-service insurance, but chargeable fees for identical services are more than twice as large for privately insured as for statutorily insured patients. Using German SOEP 2002 data, I analyze the effect of insurance status on the insured's number of doctor visits. Conditional on health, privately insured patients are less likely to contact a physician than publicly insured but more frequently visit a doctor following a first contact. This is indirect evidence for the hypothesis that physicians over-treat privately insured patients at least relative to the statutorily insured.",I

"Sten Becker|Karin Kurz","Social Inequality in Early Childhood Health - Participation in the Preventive Health Care Program for Children","This paper asks how far socioeconomic differences in parental child health investments can be explained by personal and social resources within the family. Using SOEP data from the 2003 to 2008 newborn questionnaire, we estimate multiple logistic regressions to determine the effects of migration status, education, time resources, coping competencies, and social resources (in terms of shared parenthood and childcare support by the partner and relatives) on participation in the national German preventive health care program for children (U-Untersuchungen). First, our analyses reveal strong influences of maternal education and migration status, whereas social class plays no significant role for participation in preventive health checkups for children. Second, the likelihood of participation is higher the better mothers cope with motherhood and the more time they spend with their offspring. Finally, we find mixed effects of social resources ranging from a positive influence of parents living together, over no effect of childcare support provided by the father of the child, to a seemingly negative impact of support from further kin relations. All in all, personal and social resources do not seem to play a crucial role in explaining participation in child health programs in terms of social disparities between educational and ethnic groups.",I

On the basis of the SOEP data collection periods of 1989, 1993, 2000, 2004 and 2008, I will describe participation in continuing vocational training in Germany over this time frame, and explain it in relation to two prominent theories used in the economics of education  the human capital theory and the theory of labour market segmentation.",I
"Becker, Sten|Stolberg, Carolyn","Ethnic Inequality in Preterm Birth","Preterm delivery is associated with lower health chances after birth. Women with a migration background often have a higher preterm risk (<37 gestational weeks) compared to the nonmigrant majority population. In Germany, little is known about the scope and causes for more adverse birth outcomes among immigrant women. Focusing primarily on two large migrant groups, that is first-generation Turkish and ethnic German immigrants, we examine whether these groups experience elevated preterm risk, and, if so, whether resources (e.g., economic, cultural, and social capital), health behavior (e.g., smoking during pregnancy and low utilization of prenatal care), and/or maternal constitution (height) help to explain the observed inequality relations. For the analysis, we estimate multiple logistic regression models based on the SOEP's newborn questionnaire (years 2003  2011). Our findings show that preterm birth is more prevalent among Turkish and ethnic German immigrants compared to women without a migration background. As expected, accounting for maternal constitution and resources decreases the preterm risk for all migrant groups, while  unexpectedly  a mother's and a partner's language proficiency is rather irrelevant. Health behavior during pregnancy then has no further explanatory power. After adjustment for all factors, no significant preterm differences between migrants and the nonmigrant majority population are observed.",I
"Horst Raff|Marc von der Ruhr","Foreign Direct Investment in Producer Services: Theory and Empirical Evidence","This paper examines the pattern of foreign direct investment (FDI) in producer services. Specifically we construct a model to explain the stylized fact that producer-service FDI tends to follow FDI by downstream industries. Our point is that this may be the result of informational barriers to entry into foreign markets. The preconditions of the model are shown to be consistent with panel data on U.S. FDI in 25 host countries from 1976 to 1995.",F
"Gunther Schnabl","Motivations for Foreign Exchange Intervention in Developed and Underdeveloped Capital Markets: Empirical Evidence from Croatia and Japan","The target zone model by Krugman (1991) assumes that foreign exchange intervention targets exchange rate levels. It is argued that the fit of this model depends inter alia on the stage of development of capital markets. Foreign exchange intervention of countries with highly developed capital markets is in line with Krugman's (1991) model as the exchange rate level is targeted (mostly to sustain the competitiveness of exports) and the volatility of day-to-day exchange rate changes is left to market forces. In contrast, countries with underdeveloped capital markets control both volatility of day-to-day exchange rate changes as well as long-term fluctuations of the exchange rate levels to sustain the competitiveness of exports as well as to reduce the risk for short-term and long-term payment flows. Estimations of foreign exchange intervention reaction functions for Japan and Croatia trace the asymmetric pattern of foreign exchange intervention in countries with developed and underdeveloped capital markets.",F
"Joachim Wagner","Exports and Firm Characteristics in Germany: New Evidence from Representative Panel Data","Germany is one of the leading actors on the world market for manufactured goods, but not every firm from a manufacturing industry in Germany is an exporter. In 2006, the share of exporters in all enterprises was 69 percent in West Germany and 52 percent in East Germany. Reliable information on the characteristics of exporting and non-exporting firms is important to guide theorists and policy makers in an evidence-based way. This paper uses recently released rich, high-quality data for a large representative panel of enterprises from German manufacturing industries to investigate the links between firm characteristics and export activities, demonstrating the decisive role of human capital intensity for exporting. It links these findings to the recent literature from the new new trade theory on international activities of heterogeneous firms, which emphasizes the role of productivity in exporting. It shows that productivity is important for exporting as is hypothesized in the formal theoretical models, but that contrary to the assumption made in these models, productivity is not (only) the result from a random draw from the productivity distributionit is strongly positively related to human capital intensity.",F
"Joachim Wagner","Exports and Firm Characteristics in Germany: A Survey of Empirical Studies (1991 to 2011)","Reliable information on the characteristics of exporting and non-exporting firms is important for providing theorists and policy-makers with evidence-based guidance.

This paper provides a synopsis and a critical assessment of 51 empirical studies on exports and firm characteristics based on data for German firms (establishments or enterprises) that were published over the last 20 years. I argue that this literature is not suited to provide the stylized facts needed. Reasons include the widespread use of non-representative small cross-section samples, the use of data for establishments (local production units) instead of enterprise-level data, the lack of information on important firm characteristics (including physical capital intensity and information related to innovation activities), the application of econometric methods that are not appropriate to model the share of exports in total sales and the missing control for unobserved firm heterogeneity.",F
"Mohsen Bahmani-Oskooee|Masoomeh Hajilee","German-US Commodity Trade: Is there a J-Curve Effect?","The short-run and long-run effects of currency depreciation on the trade balance of Germany have been investigated by several studies. Studies that have used aggregate trade data between Germany and the rest of the world have been said to suffer from aggregation bias. Those that disaggregated their trade data by trading partners and looked at the response of bilateral trade found neither short-run nor long-run effects. In this paper, we disaggregate bilateral trade data between Germany and the US by commodity and consider the response of the trade balance of 131 industries to real depreciations of the euro. We find that while in the short run, 91 industries respond to the depreciation of euro, these short-run effects last into the long run in 59 industries. Furthermore, the J-curve pattern was discovered in 31 cases.",F

It attempts to demonstrate that Susan Strange, representative of the British school, could be considered a critical realist. The aim of the article is to show that her vision of international political economy fulfills the methodological reorientation initiated in economics by Tony Lawson at the end of the 90s. Stranges radical ontology claims that structural power determines human actions. The paper contrasts Stranges approach with that of John Ruggie, from the American school, who identifies himself as a social constructivist. Ruggie emphasizes the role of ideational factors in international relations and the constructed nature of social reality.",F

After providing a critical review of debates about both economic justice and globalisation, the paper suggests that states retain an important degree of policy-making autonomyshould they care to exercise it. Following this I make a rather unfashionable argument which claims that, if economic justice is actually to be achieved in the contemporary era, it may be up to states to provide it. For the current structures of global governance are not only often ineffective, but they may actually entrench inequality and injustice. In the absence of a just global order, individual states may have to rely on their own efforts to achieve what economic equality they can.",F

The paper builds on earlier work and tries to identify empirically the important factors affecting debt service capacity of borrowing countries. In this study we assess the riskiness of 34 developing countries over the period 1986 to 1998 using a two-limit Tobit model. In the model a-year-ahead debt rescheduling ratios are used as the dependent variable. Using the debt rescheduling ratios, we emphasize the role of relative sizes of debt rescheduling in predicting external debt crisis. The model is tested for its predictability of the external debt crises and the results are compared with the rating of S&P and Moody's. A special emphasis is given to the recent Asian crisis and its predictability.",F

The analysis proceeds in two steps. First, it is shown single men and women â who are in some sense unconstrained optimizers â reveal identical mobility patterns. There are no fundamental gender differences in the inter-regional mobility of German singles. Second, I focus on dual-earner households and split this group into traditional and egalitarian couples using information on their factual division of housework rather than their reported gender ideology. Separate migration analyses for both groups reveal important differences indicating the significance of gender ideology in families' migration behavior: job-related characteristics of men statistically dominate those of women in traditional couples, whereas in egalitarian couples, male and female characteristics have the same effect on family migration behavior, i.e. there is no gender bias. Failure to account for the heterogeneity in gendered family roles across families thus misses an important explanatory factor in migration research.",I

The strategy proposed at European level is competition on the market, similarly to other local public services. Tuscany has been one of the first regions to actually implement the process. The experiment of a unique bidding system is currently under way, so it might represent a relevant case study on the possible effects of reform. Although not over yet, the competitive bid has already entailed some important transformations in the system of local public transport, starting processes of business integration, consolidation of operators by way of shareholding, and cost efficiency.",R

The observation of individual behaviours during the event and the comparison with the customary behaviours of the same subjects allowed to analyze their adaptability to the changed circumstances caused by the big event and their willingness to shift mode of transport. Basically, the event provided the necessary analytical conditions for a natural experiment in which to examine individual behaviours. This work describes the event and the measures taken by the Municipality to smooth the initiative. It investigates the impact of the event on mobility, also looking at the effects of urban pollution. The survey confirms how people in Florence have a high propensity to use the car and find hard to change means of transport, notwithstanding the disincentives posed by local administration and the altered relative costs.",R

"Hee-Ho Kim","Real Shocks Unemployment and the Equilibrium Real Exchange Rate","We develop a model of exogenous shocks on the real exchange rate between two large countries. We alter the model by introducing unemployment to consider the issue of how unemployment in a country can significantly change the effects of real shocks on the exchange rate. Introducing unemployment adds flexibility in production that can alter the magnitudes and even signs of shocks to the real exchange rate. These changes occur because of intersectoral differences in labor demand elasticities, as well as from differences between consumption shares in the two sectors. We explore the comparative statics demonstrating the various real shock effects on the exchange rate in the presence of unemployment. A few policy implications are drawn from the comparative statics results.",F

It also suggests that exchange rate changes and their volatility in these Asian countries respond asymmetrically to positive and negative residuals. But these effects on exchange rate changes become weaker after the Asian currency crises of 1997 came to an end.",F
"Young-Yong Kim","Foreign Capital Inflows and Real Exchange Rate: Korea, 1990s","This study attempts to discriminate between the two competing hypotheses about the causal direction between capital inflows and the real exchange rate in Korea in the 1990s. A notable observation during the period was that the current account deficits were accompanied by capital inflows. Hypothesis 1 states that the inflow of foreign capital Granger-causes the real exchange rate whereas Hypothesis 2 claims that the causal direction goes the other way. The results based on both the bivariate and four-variable vector autoregression models support the Hypothesis 1. That is, capital inflows caused the real exchange rate to appreciate, which led to the current account deficits. This implies that the timing and extent of domestic capital market liberalization are important issues for Korea and other highly indebted capital recipient countries.",F
"Han Gwang Choo","Purchasing Power Parity and Real Exchange Rates in Sri Lanka, 1977:11-1996:12","This paper examines the long-run validity of PPP for Sri Lanka by means of Johansen's multivariate cointegration methodology and the unit root test. It provides further evidence on PPP by (a) using both consumer price index and wholesale price index, (b) using nominal and real exchange rates vis-a-vis four industrial countries (Germany, Japan, the UK, and the US), and (c) studying nominal and real effective exchange rates with respect to seven major trading partners (Germany, India, Japan, Korea, Singapore, the UK, and the US). We use monthly data for the rather short-term period of 1977:11-1996:12 and find results supportive of PPP in almost all cases examined. Thus the paper renders quite a rare PPP-supporting example of a small open LDC, which suffered from chronic high unemployment rates and current account deficits, experienced rather rapid economic growth and mild inflation in comparison to other LDCs, and passed through structural changes as well.",F
"Honggue Lee","The Effects of Preferential Rules of Origin on Trade Flows","This paper estimates the effects of preferential rules of origin (PROOs) on trade flows, using a ¡°treatment¡± effect model. Exporters meet the content rules for the benefit of trade preferences, which is similar to ¡°self-selection¡± into treatment. The IV estimation of the treatment effect using OECD data shows that PROOs negatively affect the trade in intermediate inputs and final goods. Estimation results confirm that PROOs are the protectionist instrument, inducing hidden protection through an ¡°effect of tariffs¡± on imported intermediate inputs, and causing an indirect protective effect on final goods. Since preferential treatments of FTAs are conditional on compliance with PROOs, the effects of FTAs and PROOs move in the opposite direction. The net change in intermediate inputs trade will be smaller than what it would have been without PROOs. Given an inverse relationship between PROOs and intermediate inputs trade, the presence of PROOs will adversely affect final goods trade because a decrease in intermediate inputs trade distorts final goods trade.",F
"Sandeep Baliga|Tomas Sjostrom","Bargaining and War: A Review of Some Formal Models","Would perfectly rational agents always negotiate peaceful outcomes at the bargaining table, or would they sometimes fight costly wars? The Coase theorem suggests that when rational agents negotiate freely, they will reach a surplus-maximizing outcome. This seems to rule out war, since war will not in general be surplus-maximizing. However, the Coase theorem is valid only under certain assumptions, such as transferable utility (no restrictions on side-payments) and complete information. Brito and Intriligator (1985) showed how incomplete information may lead to war. An aggressor who demands concessions may simply be bluffing, so it may be rational to refuse his demands. If the aggressor is not bluffing, a war may ensue. We discuss how long such a war may last, and whether other kinds of ¡°frictions¡± (such as limited commitment power and limits on side-payments) may also lead to war.",F
"Duk Hee Lee|Hong-Ghi Min","Demand-Pull vs. Supply-Agglomeration Effects in Locational Choice of Industry : Patterns With Product Life Cycle","In the literature of spatial economics it is stylized fact that weak economies of scale and high transportation costs induce supplies of goods and services to locate very close to their markets, and large economies of scale and low transportation costs provide an incentive to gather at one place. This paper first confirms this fact in a comparative static model and then attempts to find some empirical evidence in the industry level. We classify the applicable forces into demand-pull (centrifugal) and supply-agglomeration  (centripetal). Using an observable estimator of relatively rapid growth before relocation and after relocation as an index of the weight of history versus expectations, we would suggest that future growth(centrifugal forces) tends to dominate early stages of the PLC and supply-agglomeration(centripetal forces) tends to dominate later stages of the PLC, in a majority of industries studied.",R

The level of Korea's intra-industry trade has increased rapidly; since 1980 it has been greater than Japan's Moreover, Korea's intrrr in-dustry trade has become more important in capital intensive sectors over time The increase of Korea's intra-industry trade is related to the growth of per capita income trade liberalization, and the increase of foreign direct investment.",F
"Honggue Lee","Strategic Use of Private Information and Antidumping Petition","This paper considers a signaling game in which an import competing firm files antidumping petition against its foreign competitor in its own market in order to secure the non-duty effects. In this game, abusive antidumping occurs when the domestic firm files petition strategically, as it takes advantage of private information regarding its filing motivations. A strategic use of antidumping can be made possible when a pooling or a semi-separating equilibrium is obtained, which takes place when the outcome filer happens to be a high-cost type. In this case, no separating equilibrium exists, in which the outcome filer files and the process filer withdraws. That is, the outcome filer may make so much efforts that its payoff net of petitioning expenses can be less than that it can obtain by withdrawing. Or the process filer may spend so little that its payoff for not filing cannot be greater than that for filing. This possibility of abusive antidumping, a pooling or a semi-separating equilibrium, depends on the probability that the domestic firm is an outcome (or a process) filer, the expected loss that the foreign exporter might suffer due to antidumping, the initial profits that the foreign exporter earns in the home market, the cost competitiveness of the domestic firm, the initial sales to the home market, and the effects of a VER on the foreign exporter's reaction function. The existence of a pooling equilibrium shows why there are so many antidumping petitions, many of which come from outdated, less competitive industries.",F
"Jung Sik Kim","The Won-Yen Exchange Rate and Purchasing Power Party During the Recent Float","Recent findings on PPP suggest that the deviation from PPP have not been self correcting between countries with large disparities in rates of inflation. Korea has experienced high inflation rates than Japan during 1980s and 1990s and so, under the current exchange rate system, the won-yen exchange rate may be misaligned. In this paper, we test the long-run PPP hypothesis for the won-yen exchange rate in Korea during 1980-1997, and find that the real exchange rate follows a random walk and there exists no cointegration relationship between the exchange rate and prices. The results show that the PPP hypothesis does not hold for the won-yen exchange rate, and suggest that the PPP condition will not hold for countries which experience large disparities in the rates of inflation.",F

Among the more important lessons is that the United States should not be lulled into a false sense of budget complacency by the very-low interest rates at which its government can presently fund itself. Rather, the United States should embark upon a serious program of medium-term budget adjustment if it is to avoid going further down the path to fiscal ruin. The European experience also suggests that medium-term fiscal consolidation is best effected through public spending cuts rather than tax increases, and that such an adjustment effort should be supported by accommodative monetary policy action.",F

FTZs have flourished in emerging nations, even within autocracies that rhetorically oppose open trade. FTZs possess many attributes of capitalist economies -- free exchange, low taxes, no tariffs or other customs rules, and light regulation. All of these traits can attract foreign companies, foreign investment in domestic companies, industrial production, and overall wealth generation. However, such zones are also troubling; they can produce several negative results including a strong mafia presence, massive counterfeit operations, tax evasion, money laundering, and even terror financing. At best, FTZs are workarounds that are desirable only when the political system is captured by vested interests that limit international trade. At worst, they are deniable locations for odious regimes to gain hard currency and even credibility.",F

We find that, while working women may be at a greater risk of violence, higher earnings are associated with a reduction in violence. Although these findings are informative, they do not necessarily establish a causal link between economic empowerment and violence. To test for causality, we exploit arguably exogenous variation in state laws designed to equalize the inheritance rights of sons and daughters. Additional variation comes from the fact that these state laws did not apply to some women based on their religious affiliation and date of marriage. We find some evidence that women who were subject to these laws are less likely to report being victims of domestic violence.",F

We employ these estimates to characterize the recent boom/bust cycle in land prices and house prices in the Washington area at a fine level of geography. The data show that land prices were more volatile than house prices everywhere, but especially so in the areas where land was inexpensive in 2000. In those areas, the land share of property value jumped during the boom, and this rise in the land share was a useful predictor of the subsequent crash in house prices. These results highlight the value of focusing on land for assessing house-price risk. In ongoing work, we are exploring how much of the spatial variation in land-price changes can be linked to high-risk mortgage lending and fundamentals such as housing rents, income growth, and employment.",R

Entering the workforce one year later also has implications for lifetime earnings and remittances to governments.

Mentally ill people are less likely to be employed and, if employed, more likely to be out sick or working below par.

When an employer fills a vacancy with one of its own workers (through promotion or lateral transfer), it forgoes the opportunity to fill the position with a new hire from outside the firm. Although both internal and external hiring methods are used, firms frequently have a bias favoring insiders. Internal and external hires differ in observable characteristics (such as skill levels), as do the employers making each type of hiring decision. Understanding those differences helps employers design and manage hiring policies that are appropriate for their organizations.",M

This effect is largest among the teams that in the previous season just failed to qualify. This suggests that changes in prize structure leads to changes in investment decisions amongst those clubs most affected at the margin. However, we also find that incumbent teams that have already qualified for the Champions' League simultaneously raise their efforts, consistent with the occurrence of an arms race among top European football teams.",M

Exploiting detailed information on children's health, family background, mothers' pre-birth work histories and mothers' health behaviours during pregnancy within a propensity score matching framework, we show that paid parental leave entitlements reduce the probability of a child having multiple ongoing health conditions, but do not significantly affect any single condition. We find that the effect on multiple conditions is strongest for children from lower socio-economic backgrounds. Our study implies that the provision of paid parental leave, even for short periods (as usually available in Australia), will benefit children's health.",I

This relationship may form an important part of the phenomenon of low social mobility as well as inefficiently low investment in human capital by youth who have parents with relatively low educational attainment. Is it a genetic inter-generational transmission of innate ability from parents to their children (i.e. nature) or is it the environment that the better educated parents provide for their children (i.e. nurture) that explains this positive relationship?

Our results also show that anti-bullying policy mandates are associated with a reduction in minor teen school shooting deaths and violent crime arrests. A causal interpretation of our results is supported by falsification tests on older young adults for whom ABLs do not bind.",I
"Frederiksen, Anders","Job Satisfaction and Employee Turnover: A Firm-Level Perspective","In this paper, I study an employment situation where the employer and the employees cooperate about the implementation of a job satisfaction survey. Cooperation is valuable because it improves the firm's ability to predict employee quits, but it is only an equilibrium outcome because the employer-employee relation is repeated and long-term. Using a unique combination of firm-level data and information from job satisfaction surveys, the empirical analysis reveals that the cooperation reduces the firm's employee turnover costs significantly by improving its ability to predict quits. This cost reduction may easily exceed the cost of conducting the survey. The analysis also reveals that the firm is willing to sacrifice profits in a given year to be able to sustain the cooperative relationship with the employees.",M

This article focuses on trends in minimum wages, income taxes, and work-related benefits within a selection of 16 EU countries, for the period 2001-2012, with three US states included as reference cases. We find evidence for eroding relative minimum wages in various EU countries, yet combined with catch-up growth in the new Member States. We also find that governments counteracted eroding minimum wages through direct income support measures, especially for lone parents. Most prevalent among these were substantial declines in income tax liabilities. More generally we see a trend unfolding towards a fiscalization of income support policies.",I

"Holt, Stephen B.|Gershenson, Seth","The Impact of Teacher Demographic Representation on Student Attendance and Suspensions","Representative bureaucracy theory is central to public administration scholarship due to the likely relationship between the demographic composition of the public workforce and both the actual and perceived performance of public organizations. Primary school classrooms provide an ideal context in which to test the predictions of representative bureaucracy theory at the micro (student) level. Specifically, since parents have at least some agency over primary school students' daily attendance, absences reflect parental assessments of their child's school, classroom, and teacher. The representativeness of the teacher workforce, and specifically that of the student's classroom teacher, is therefore likely to influence student absenteeism. Similarly, student suspensions reflect students' relationships with their teacher, students' comfort level in the classroom, and teachers' discretion in the referral of misbehavior.",I

Applying this intuition to incentive pay contracts, we develop a model and an experiment that show, in a very general setting, that the choice between work effort and leisure under given linear incentives depends on how the attendant financial risk interacts with effort. We find that if the risk multiplies with effort, risk-averse individuals work less, whereas under additive risk effort choice is little affected by risk preferences. Our findings complement the literature on worker selection into incentive pay contracts by showing that lower effort of the risk-averse is another type of behavior toward risk. Our study is relevant to practice as well, since many jobs, such as commission work, feature multiplicative rather additive risk.",M

Official data show a steep growth of private schooling and a corresponding rapid shrinkage in the size of the government school sector in India, suggesting parental abandonment of government schools. Data show that a very large majority of private schools in most states are 'low-fee' when judged in relation 	to: state per capita income, per-pupil expenditure in the government schools, and the officially-stipulated rural minimum wage rate for daily-wage-labour. This suggests that affordability is an important factor behind the migration towards and growth of private schools.",I

The results of both methods (and of variations on these methods) are very similar and cannot reject that the class size effect is equal to zero.

The key advantage of our data is that we are able to identify these events on a quarterly basis rather than on the yearly basis used by previous studies. We find evidence that life events are not randomly distributed, that individuals to a large extent anticipate major events and that they quickly adapt. These effects have important implications for the calculation of monetary values needed to compensate individuals for life events such as crime or death of spouse. We find that our new valuation methodology that incorporates these dynamic factors produces considerably smaller compensation valuations than those calculated using the standard approach.",I
"Konstantopoulos, Spyros","Incorporating Cost in Power Analysis for Three-Level Cluster Randomized Designs","In experimental designs with nested structures entire groups (such as schools) are often assigned to treatment conditions. Key aspects of the design in these cluster randomized experiments include knowledge of the intraclass correlation structure and the sample sizes necessary to achieve adequate power to detect the treatment effect. However, the units at each level of the hierarchy have a cost associated with them and thus researchers need to decide on sample sizes given a certain budget, when designing their studies. This paper provides methods for computing power within an optimal design framework (that incorporates costs of units in all three levels) for three-level cluster randomized balanced designs with two levels of nesting. The optimal sample sizes are a function of the variances at each level and the cost of each unit. Overall, larger effect sizes, smaller intraclass correlations at the second and third level, and lower cost of level-3 and level-2 units result in higher estimates of power.",I

"Kramarz, Francis|Machin, Stephen|Ouazad, Amine","What Makes a Test Score? The Respective Contributions of Pupils, Schools, and Peers in Achievement in English Primary Education","This study develops an analytical framework for evaluating the respective contributions of pupils, peers, and school quality in affecting educational achievement. We implement this framework using rich data from England that matches pupils to their primary schools. The dataset records all English pupils and their test scores in Key Stage 1 (age 7) and Key Stage 2 (age 11) national examinations. The quality of the data source, coupled with our econometric techniques, allows us to assess the respective importance of different educational inputs. We can distinguish school effects, that affect all pupils irrespective of their year and grade of study, from school-grade-year effects. Identification of pupil effects separately from these school-grade-year effects is achieved because students are mobile across schools. Peer effects are identified assuming variations in school-grade-year group composition in adjacent years are exogenous. We estimate three different specifications, the most general allowing Key Stage 2 results to be affected by the Key Stage 1 school(-grade-year) at which the pupil studied. We discuss the validity of our various exogeneity assumptions. Estimation results show statistically significant pupil ability, school and peer effects. Our analysis suggests the following 	ranking: pupils' ability and background are more important than school time-invariant inputs. Peer effects are significant, but small.",I
"Bressoux, Pascal|Kramarz, Francis|Prost, Corinne","Teachers' Training, Class Size and Students' Outcomes: Learning from Administrative Forecasting Mistakes","This paper studies the impact of different teacher and class characteristics on third graders' outcomes. It uses a feature of the French system in which some novice teachers start their jobs before receiving any training. Three categories of teachers are included in the 	sample: experienced teachers, trained novice teachers and untrained novice teachers. To identify the effects, we use administrative mistakes in forecasting the number of teachers. We find that trained and untrained novice teachers are assigned to similar classes, whereas experienced teachers have better students located in better environments. Hence, in order to match similar students and classes, we focus on pupils with novice teachers and discard those with experienced teachers. In addition, we show that the same sample can be used to estimate the causal effect of class size on students' outcomes. Our findings are: (1) teachers' training substantially improves students' test scores in mathematics; (2) this training effect does not rely on different teaching practices, but mainly on subject matter competence; untrained teachers who majored in sciences at university improve their students' achievement as much as trained teachers do; (3) the class size effect is substantial and significant; class size does not seem to be correlated with instructional practices; (4) teachers' training does not improve the scores of initially low-achieving students and classes; on the contrary, a smaller class is more beneficial to low-achieving students within classes and to all students in low-achieving classes.",I
"Boyce, Christopher J.|Oswald, Andrew J.","Do People Become Healthier after Being Promoted?","This paper uses longitudinal data to explore whether greater job status makes a person healthier. Taking the evidence as a whole, promotees do not exhibit a health improvement after promotion. Instead the data suggest that workers with good health are more likely to be promoted. In the private sector, we find that job promotion significantly worsens people's psychological strain (on a GHQ score). For the public sector, there are some tentative signs of the reverse. We discuss caveats to our conclusions, suggest caution in their interpretation, and argue that further longitudinal studies are needed.",I
"Epstein, Gil S.|Lecker, Tikva","Multi-Generation Model of Immigrant Earnings: Theory and Application","The literature, starting with Chiswick (1977, 1978) to Gang and Zimmermann (2000), more recently, focuses on the economic achievements and performance of first- and second-generation migrants. This paper presents a three-generation migrant analysis, comparing relative economic performance of various migrant generations to one another and to the native population. We developed a theoretical model, which was then explored empirically using data from the 1995 Israeli Census. In both the theoretical and empirical analyses, the curve describing intergenerational immigrant earnings mobility is inversely U-shaped. The second generation earns relatively more than the first and third generations, while the third generation earns less than the second, but more than the first. Thus, assimilation of the third generation into the local population is far from clear.",F
"Albrecht, James|van Ours, Jan C.","Using Employer Hiring Behavior to Test the Educational Signaling Hypothesis","This paper presents a test of the educational signaling hypothesis. If employers use education as a signal in the hiring process, they will rely more on education when less is otherwise known about applicants. We find that employers are more likely to lower educational standards when an informal, more informative recruitment channel is used, so we conclude that education is used as a signal in the hiring process.",I
"Haegeland, Torbjørn|Raaum, Oddbjørn|Salvanes, Kjell G.","Pupil Achievement, School Resources and Family Background","Whether increasing resource use in schools has a positive effect on pupil performance has occupied governments, parents and researchers for decades. A main challenge when trying to answer this question is to separate the effects of school resources from the effects of pupils family background, since resources may be allocated in a compensatory manner, and pupils may sort into schools. We address these issues using a comprehensive dataset for two cohorts of pupils graduating from lower secondary school in Norway. The dataset is rich in performance measures, resource use variables and family background variables. As performance measures we use results at age 16 across 11 subjects, and we exploit the fact that we have both information from results from national exams and from continuous assessment in class. Controlling for family background, we find a positive but modest effect of resource quantity such as teacher hours per pupil, on pupil achievement. Observable teacher qualifications, within the variation present in lower secondary school in Norway, do not appear to have significant effects on school results. Resource quality as measured by teacher characteristics does not appear to have a significant impact on pupils marks. We find clear evidence of compensating resource allocation and teacher sorting as well as relative setting of marks.",I
"Brunello, Giorgio|Checchi, Daniele","School Vouchers Italian Style","School vouchers introduced recently in some Italian regions have lowered the cost of private schools. On one side, we provide evidence that Italian private schools may be selected for different reasons than quality considerations. On the other side, by exploiting individual data on voucher applicants, we present evidence that the percentage of voucher applicants is higher the higher the average quality of private schools, which we explain with the fact that better quality schools provide better services to students, including information and consulting on vouchers. We show that enrolment in private schools responds sluggishly to changes in tuition induced by vouchers. Under stringent assumptions, we estimate the slopes of demand and supply of private education in the largest Italian region, Lombardy, during the first two years since implementation of a voucher scheme, and provide a quantitative assessment of the long-term impact of vouchers on tuition fees and enrolment in private schools.",I
"Maurin, Eric|McNally, Sandra","Vive la Révolution! Long Term Returns of 1968 to the Angry Students","The famous events of May 1968, starting with student riots, threw France into a state of turmoil. The period of revolution coincided with the time in which important examinations are undertaken. Normal procedures were abandoned and the pass-rate for various qualifications increased enormously. These events were particularly important for students at an early (and highly selective) phase of higher education. They are shown to have pursued further years of education because thresholds were lowered at critical stages. These historic events provide a natural experiment to analyse the returns to years of higher education for the affected generation and to consider consequences for their children. Thus, we contribute to debate on two very controversial 	questions: What is the true causal relationship between educational attainment and its labour market value? Is there a causal relationship between the education of parents and that of their children? Unlike most of the literature, we consider the effect of an intervention which alters an individuals years of higher education rather than compulsory schooling. The results show a relatively high return, which might indicate that private returns are higher for the former. Furthermore, the treatment group is on the margin of the higher education system. This study suggests that expanding the university system to accommodate such people can yield very high private returns. Hence our study suggests very positive effects of the 1968 events for affected cohorts and is of contemporary relevance given the current debate in many countries about widening access to higher education.",I
"van den Berg, Bernard|Hassink, Wolter","Moral Hazard and Cash Benefits in Long-Term Home Care","This paper tests empirically for ex-post moral hazard in a system based on demand-side subsidies. In the Netherlands, demand-side subsidies were introduced in 1996. Clients receive a cash benefit to purchase the type of home care (housework, personal care, support with mobility, organisational tasks or social support) they need from the care supplier of their choice (private care provider, regular care agency, commercial care agency or paid informal care provider). Furthermore, they negotiate with the care supplier about price and quantity. Our main findings are the following. 1) The component of the cash benefit a client has no residual claimant on, has a positive impact on the price of care. 2) In contrast, the components of the cash benefit a client has residual claimant on, have no or a negative impact on the price of care. Both results point at the existence of ex-post moral hazard in a system of demand-side subsidies.",I
"Mayda, Anna Maria","International Migration: A Panel Data Analysis of Economic and Non-Economic Determinants","In this paper I empirically investigate economic and non-economic determinants of migration inflows into fourteen OECD countries by country of origin, between 1980 and 1995. The annual panel data set used makes it possible to exploit both the time-series and cross-country variation in immigrant inflows. I focus on both supply and demand determinants of migration patterns and find results broadly consistent with the theoretical predictions of a standard international-migration model. Both first and second moments of the income distribution in the destination and origin countries shape international migration movements. In particular, I find evidence of robust and significant pull effects, that is the positive impact on immigrant inflows of improvements in the mean income opportunities in the host country. Inequality in the origin and destination economies affects the size of migration rates as predicted by Borjas (1987) selection model. Finally, among the non-economic determinants, I investigate the impact on emigration rates of geographical, cultural, and demographic factors as well as the role played by changes in destination countries' migration policies.",F
"Gundersen, Craig|Ribar, David C.","Food Insecurity and Insufficiency at Low Levels of Food Expenditures","This study uses data from the December 2003 Food Security Supplement of the CPS to compare the food insufficiency and insecurity measures with objective measures of food expenditures and objective and subjective measures of food needs. The study examines the general relationships between these variables and finds that reports of food hardships are positively associated with food expenditures and negatively associated with needs. The study goes on to examine reports of food hardships at low very levels of food expenditures, where we conjecture that most people should experience food problems. When expenditures are scaled by an objective measure of needs, there is no point along the expenditure distribution where more than half of the survey respondents report experiencing being food insufficient or insecure. However, when expenditures are scaled by a subjective threshold, we observe near-universal reporting of food problems at low levels of expenditures. The findings indicate that the food insufficiency and insecurity measures each incorporate a large subjective component, which limits the usefulness of the measures for comparing the extent of food hardships across populations or over time or evaluating the effects of assistance programs.",I
"Borghans, Lex|Golsteyn, Bart H.H.","Time Discounting and the Body Mass Index","In many Western countries, the relative weight of people - measured by the Body Mass Index (BMI) - has increased substantially in recent years, leading to an increasing incidence of overweight and related health problems. As with many forms of risky behavior, it is plausible that overweight is related to the individual discount rate. Increases in credit card debts, the rise in gambling and the development of a more hedonic life style, suggest that the average discount rate has increased over time. This increase may have been the cause of the increase in BMI. Applying a large set of indicators for the individual discount rate, this paper analyzes whether changes in time discounting can account for differences in body mass between individuals at a given point in time and whether changes in the average individual discount rate can explain the remarkable increase in BMI experienced in recent years. We find some evidence for a link between time discounting and differences in BMI between people, but this relationship depends strongly on the choice of the proxy for the discount rate. Giving our hypothesis the best chance, we analyze the development of the time discounting proxies that are most strongly related to BMI. We find no evidence for a change of these proxies over time. Our main conclusion therefore is that overweight might be related to the way people discount future health benefits, but the increase in BMI has to be explained by shifts in other parameters that determine the intertemporal decisions regarding the trade-off of current and future health and satisfaction.",I
"Stratton, Leslie S.|O'Toole, Dennis M.|Wetzel, James N.","A Multinomial Logit Model of College Stopout and Dropout Behavior","Studies of college attrition typically assume that all attrition is permanent. We use data from the 1990/94 Beginning Postsecondary Survey to distinguish between long-term dropout and short-term stopout behavior in order to test that assumption. We find significant differences between those who stop out and those who drop out in the first year. Failure to recognize these differences biases the results of standard attrition models and hence may cause policy makers to pursue inappropriate policy initiatives or incorrectly target at-risk populations. Furthermore, the type of financial aid received is found to have a differential impact on stopout versus dropout probabilities.",I

"Konstantopoulos, Spyros","Trends of School Effects on Student Achievement: Evidence from NLS:72, HSB:82, and NELS:92","The impact of schools on student achievement has been of great interest for the last four decades. This study examines trends of school effects on student achievement employing three national probability samples of high school 	seniors: NLS:72, HSB:82, and NELS:92. Hierarchical linear models are used to investigate school effects. The findings reveal that the substantial proportion of the variation in student achievement lies within schools not between schools. There is also considerable between school variation in achievement, which becomes larger over time. Schools are more diverse and more segregated in the 1990s than in the 1970s. In addition, school characteristics such as school region, school SES, and certain characteristics of the student body of the school, such as students daily attendance, students in college preparatory classes, and high school graduates enrolled in colleges are important predictors of average student achievement. The school predictors explained consistently more than 50% of the variation in average student achievement across surveys. We also find considerable teacher heterogeneity in achievement within schools, which suggests important teacher effects on student achievement. Teacher heterogeneity in student achievement was larger than school heterogeneity, which may indicate that teacher effects have a relatively larger impact on mathematics and science student achievement than school effects.",I
"Turcotte, Leo|Robst, John|Polachek, Solomon","Medical Interventions among Pregnant Women in Fee-for-Service and Managed Care Insurance: A Propensity Score Analysis","We extend prior research on the effect of managed care on the receipt of four medical interventions for pregnant 	women: ultrasound, induction/stimulation of birth, electronic fetal monitor, and cesarean delivery. Propensity score methods are used to account for sample selection issues regarding insurance choice. Managed care enrollees are more likely to receive an ultrasound, which may be indicative of receiving better prenatal care. Managed care plans reduce the rate of cesarean deliveries, but such limitations may be beneficial given the substantial medical evidence that cesarean deliveries are over utilized. The results indicate that insurance coverage does influence treatment intensity, but that utilization controls and provider financial incentives do not adversely affect care for pregnant women.",I
"Doyle, Orla|Harmon, Colm P.|Walker, Ian","The Impact of Parental Income and Education on the Health of their Children","This paper investigates the robustness of recent findings on the effect of parental background on child health. We are particularly concerned with the extent to which their finding that income effects on child health are the result of spurious correlation rather than some causal mechanism. A similar argument can be made for the effect of education - if parental education and child health are correlated with some common unobservable (say, low parental time preference) then least squares estimates of the effect of parental education will be biased upwards. Moreover, it is very common for parental income data to be grouped, in which case income is measured with error and the coefficient on income will be biased towards zero and there are good reasons why the extent of bias may vary with child age. Fixed effect estimation is undermined by measurement error and here we adopt the traditional solution to both spurious correlation and measurement error and use an instrumental variables approach. Our results suggest that the income effects observed in the data are spurious.",I
"Adda, Jérôme|Cornaglia, Francesca","Taxes, Cigarette Consumption and Smoking Intensity","This paper analyses the compensatory behavior of smokers. Exploiting data on cotinine concentration  a metabolite of nicotine  measured in a large population of smokers over time, we show that smokers compensate tax hikes by extracting more nicotine per cigarette. Our study makes two important contributions. First, as smoking more intensively a given cigarette is detrimental to health, our results question the usefulness of tax increases. Second, we develop a model of rational addiction where agents can also adjust their intensity of smoking and we show that the previous empirical results suffer from severe estimation biases.",I
"Hanushek, Eric A.|Woessmann, Ludger","Does Educational Tracking Affect Performance and Inequality? Differences-in-Differences Evidence across Countries","Even though some countries track students into differing-ability schools by age 10, others keep their entire secondary-school system comprehensive. To estimate the effects of such institutional differences in the face of country heterogeneity, we employ an international differences-in-differences approach. We identify tracking effects by comparing differences in outcome between primary and secondary school across tracked and non-tracked systems. Six international student assessments provide eight pairs of achievement contrasts for between 18 and 26 cross-country comparisons. The results suggest that early tracking increases educational inequality. While less clear, there is also a tendency for early tracking to reduce mean performance. Therefore, there does not appear to be any equity-efficiency trade-off.",I
"Oswald, Andrew J.|Wu, Stephen","Objective Confirmation of Subjective Measures of Human Well-being: Evidence from the USA","A huge research literature, across the behavioral and social sciences, uses information on individuals' subjective well-being. These are responses to questions  asked by survey interviewers or medical personnel  such as how happy do you feel on a scale from 1 to 4? Yet there is little scientific evidence that such data are meaningful. This study examines a 2005-2008 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System random sample of 1.3 million United States citizens. Life-satisfaction in each U.S. state is measured. Across America, people's answers trace out the same pattern of quality of life as previously estimated, using solely non-subjective data, in a literature from economics (so-called 'compensating differentials' neoclassical theory due originally to Adam Smith). There is a state-by-state match (r = 0.6, p < 0.001) between subjective and objective well-being. This result has some potential to help to unify disciplines.",I
"Machin, Stephen|Salvanes, Kjell G.","Valuing School Quality via a School Choice Reform","Among policymakers, educators and economists there remains a strong, sometimes heated, debate on the extent to which good schools matter. This is seen, for instance, in the strong trend towards establishing accountability systems in education in many countries across the world. In this paper, in line with some recent studies, we value school quality using house prices. We, however, adopt a rather different approach to other work, using a policy experiment regarding pupils' choice to attend high schools to identify the relationship between house prices and school performance. We exploit a change in school choice policy that took place in Oslo county in 1997, where the school authorities opened up the possibility for every pupil to apply to any of the high schools in the county without having to live in the school's catchment area (the rule that applied before 1997). Our estimates show evidence that parents substantially value better performing schools since the sensitivity of housing valuations to school performance falls significantly by over 50% following the school choice reform.",I
"Grund, Christian|Höcker, Jan|Zimmermann, Stefan","Risk Taking Behavior in Tournaments: Evidence from the NBA","We empirically explore the relevance of risk taking behavior in tournaments. We make use of data from the NBA season 2007/2008 and measure risk taking by the fraction of three-point shots. Current heterogeneity of teams is taken into account by intermediate results. It turns out that indeed teams who are behind increase the risk in terms of more three-point attempts. We additionally analyze the consequences of this change in behavior. Enhanced risk taking is inefficient for the vast majority of cases and only beneficial in terms of a higher winning probability if a team is behind with a rather large amount of points. We discuss possible explanations for these decision errors.",M
"BenDavid-Hadar, Iris|Ziderman, Adrian","A New Model for Equitable and Efficient Resource Allocation to Schools: The Israeli Case","This paper sets out a new budget allocation formula for schools, designed to achieve a more equitable distribution of educational achievement. In addition to needs-based elements, the suggested composite allocation formula includes an improvement component, whereby schools receive budgetary allocations based on a new incentive measure developed in this paper (Improvement in the Educational Achievement Distribution, or IEAD). The development of the budget allocation formula is demonstrated utilizing Israeli data. Large scale, nationwide data sets relating students academic achievement to student background variables, teacher profiles and school characteristics, were analyzed to identify appropriate needs-based formula components and to estimate their weights. The results are compared with the funding formulas currently used in Israel.",I

Class size and time-in-term are both important school choice variables and we examine how provincial achievement differences would change if the Alberta distribution of class size and time-in-term prevailed in the other provinces. Results differ by province, and for provinces where mean achievement gaps would be lower, not all students would benefit.",I

The roles of establishment size, multinational ownership and the human resources management department in the incidence of pay for performance plans and their variability of use across occupations within the same firm are also studied. These factors are found to correlate to a greater use of pay for performance and, in most cases, this effect is homogenous across occupations.",M
"Lei, Xiaoyan|Yin, Nina|Zhao, Yaohui","SES Health Gradients during the Epidemiological Transition: The Case of China","The epidemiological transition, which has already passed the developed world, is still progressing in many developing countries. A particular problem associated with this transition is the under-diagnosis and lack of treatment of chronic diseases, and these may exhibit SES gradients and exacerbate social inequality. Using hypertension as an example and data from China (CHNS), we find that the prevalence of hypertension in China is already close to levels in developed countries, under-diagnosis is pervasive, treatment is rare, and failure to control is widespread. Consistent with the literature, we find no income and education gradients in the prevalence of hypertension. However, there are strong education gradients in diagnosis and treatment in urban areas. The income gradients in all aspects of hypertension are relatively weak and sometimes nonexistent. Interestingly, we find that access to health care does not contribute to the diagnosis of hypertension, nor does it aid much in the treatment and control of hypertension. Our results suggest that the epidemiological transition has indeed occurred, but both the Chinese public and its health care system are ill-prepared. There is an urgent need to educate the public on chronic illnesses, and to raise the quality of health care so that patients receive proper diagnoses and guidance on how to treat and control those chronic illnesses.",I
"Black, Sandra E.|Devereux, Paul J.|Salvanes, Kjell G.","Under Pressure? The Effect of Peers on Outcomes of Young Adults","A variety of public campaigns, including the Just Say No campaign of the 1980s and 1990s that encouraged teenagers to Just Say No to Drugs, are based on the premise that teenagers are very susceptible to peer influences. Despite this, very little is known about the effect of school peers on the long-run outcomes of teenagers. This is primarily due to two 	factors: the absence of information on peers merged with long-run outcomes of individuals and, equally important, the difficulty of separately identifying the role of peers. This paper uses data on the population of Norway and idiosyncratic variation in cohort composition within schools to examine the role of peer composition in 9th grade on longer-run outcomes such as IQ scores at age 18, teenage childbearing, post-compulsory schooling educational track, adult labor market status, and earnings. We find that outcomes are influenced by the proportion of females in the grade, and these effects differ for men and women. Other peer variables (average age, average mother's education) have little impact on the outcomes of teenagers.",I

It is unique in being able to follow two cohorts of students in England  those who took GCSEs in 2001-02 and 2002-03  from age 11 to age 20. The findings suggest that while there remain large raw gaps in HE participation (and participation at high-status universities) by socio-economic status, these differences are substantially reduced once controls for prior attainment are included. Moreover, these findings hold for both state and private school students. This suggests that poor attainment in secondary schools is more important in explaining lower HE participation rates amongst students from disadvantaged backgrounds than barriers arising at the point of entry into HE. These findings highlight the need for earlier policy intervention to raise HE participation rates amongst disadvantaged youth.",I
"Banks, James|Muriel, Alastair|Smith, James P.","Disease Prevalence, Disease Incidence, and Mortality in the United States and in England","We find disease incidence and prevalence are both higher among Americans in age groups 55-64 and 70-80 indicating that Americans suffer from higher past cumulative disease risk and experience higher immediate risk of new disease onset compared to the English. In contrast, age specific mortality rates are similar in the two countries with an even higher risk among the English after age 65. Our second aim explains large financial gradients in mortality in the two countries. Among 55-64 year olds, we estimate similar health gradients in income and wealth in both countries, but for 70-80 year old, we find no income gradient in UK. Standard behavioral risk factors (work, marriage, obesity, exercise, and smoking) almost fully explain income gradients among 55-64 years old in both countries and a significant part among Americans 70-80 years old. The most likely explanation of no English income gradient relates to their income benefit system. Below the median, retirement benefits are largely flat and independent of past income and hence past health during the working years. Finally, we report evidence using a long panel of American respondents that their subsequent mortality is not related to large changes in wealth experienced during the prior ten year period.",I
"Strauss, John|Lei, Xiaoyan|Park, Albert|Shen, Yan|Smith, James P.|Yang, Zhe|Zhao, Yaohui","Health Outcomes and Socio-Economic Status among the Elderly in China: Evidence from the CHARLS Pilot","We are concerned in this paper with measuring health outcomes among the elderly in Zhejiang and Gansu provinces, China, and examining the relationships between different dimensions of health status and measures of socio-economic status (SES). We use the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) pilot data to document health conditions among the elderly in Gansu and Zhejiang provinces, where the survey was fielded. We use a very rich set of health indicators that include both self-reported measures and biomarkers. We also examine correlations between these health outcomes and two important indicators of socioeconomic status (SES): education and log of per capita expenditure (log pce), our preferred measure of household resources. While there exists a very large literature that examines the relationships between SES and health measures, little has been done on Chinese data to see whether correlations reported in many other countries are replicated in China, particularly so for the aged. In general education tends to be positively correlated with better health outcomes, as it is in other countries. However, unmeasured community influences turn out to be highly important, much more so than one usually finds in other countries. While it is not yet clear which aspects of communities matter and why they matter, we set up an agenda for future research on this topic. We also find a large degree of under-diagnosis of hypertension, a major health problems that afflicts the aged. This implies that the current health system is not well prepared to address the rapid aging of the Chinese population, at least not in Gansu and Zhejiang.",I

Investigating the links between health and SES is one of the primary goals of the ELSA and HRS, so attrition correlated with these outcomes is a critical concern. We explored some possible reasons for these differences. Survey maturity, mobility, respondent burden, interviewer quality, and differing sampling methods all fail to account for the gap. Differential respondent incentives may play some role, but the impact of respondent incentive is difficult to test. Apparently, cultural differences between the US and Europe population in agreeing to participate and remain in scientific surveys are a more likely explanation.",I
"Wagner, Joachim","The Post-Entry Performance of Cohorts of Export Starters in German Manufacturing Industries","This paper investigates four cohorts of firms from German manufacturing industries that started to export in the years between 1998 and 2002 and follows them over the five years after the start. Export starters are a rare species and they are small on average compared to incumbent exporters. Between 30 percent and 40 percent of the starters became continuous exporters; some starters stepped out and back into exporting, many of them more than once. The share of total exports contributed by export starters of a cohort is tiny in the start year, and it remains so over the years to follow, although those starters that were exporters in year t+5 had a share of exports in total sales that was more than twice as high as the average share of exports in total sales among the export starters of the same cohort in year t. Contrary to the market selection hypothesis there is no evidence that productivity in the start year is systematically related to survival in the export market. There is no evidence for a negative impact of a smaller firm size in the start year on the chance to survive on the export market. Starting with a higher share of exports in total sales, however, tends to increase the probability to stay on the export market.",F
"Wagner, Joachim","Exports and Firm Characteristics in German Manufacturing Industries","Reliable information on the characteristics of exporting and non-exporting firms is important to guide theorists and policy makers in an evidence based way. This holds true especially for Germany, a leading actor on the world markets for goods and services. This paper makes three contributions towards this 	aim: (1) It provides a synopsis and a critical assessment of 51 empirical studies on exports and firm characteristics that use data for German establishments or enterprises, arguing that this literature is not suited to extract the stylized facts needed. (2) It uses recently released rich high quality data for a large representative panel of enterprises from German manufacturing industries to investigate the links between firm characteristics and export activities, demonstrating the decisive role of human capital intensity for exporting. (3) It links these findings to the recent literature from the new new trade theory on international activities of heterogeneous firms that emphasises the role of productivity for exporting. It shows that productivity is important for exporting as is hypothesized in the formal theoretical models, but that contrary to the assumption made in these models productivity is not (only) the result from a random draw from the productivity distribution  it is strongly positively related to human capital intensity.",F
"Bandick, Roger|Görg, Holger|Karpaty, Patrik","Foreign Acquisitions, Domestic Multinationals, and R&D","The aim of this paper is to evaluate the causal effect of foreign acquisition on R&D intensity in targeted domestic firms. We are able to distinguish domestic multinationals and non-multinationals, which allows us to investigate the fear that the change in ownership of domestic to foreign multinationals leads to a reduction in R&D activity in the country, as headquarter activities are relocated to the new owner's home country. We use unique and rich firm level data for the Swedish manufacturing sector and different micro-econometric estimation strategies in order to control for the potential endogeneity of the acquisition dummy. Overall, our results give no support to the fears that foreign acquisition of domestic firms lead to a brain drain of R&D activity in Swedish MNEs. Rather, this paper finds robust evidence that foreign acquisitions lead to increasing R&D intensity in acquired domestic MNEs and non-MNEs.",F

Most hypotheses are supported by the empirical evidence. Job status and firm size are the most relevant characteristics for training participation. Furthermore, our analyses reveal a general trend of rising training rates from 1989 to 2008 indicating an increased importance in the German labor market.",M

We begin by exploring the three broad research areas that economists examine when researching immigration. We then explore the strengths and shortcomings of the standard methods, and highlight new methods that will likely become more common in future work in the field. We divide the most common tools used in the empirical literature into four broad 	categories: (1) Ordinary Least Squares and Inference, (2) Difference-in-Difference Estimation, (3) Instrumental Variables Techniques, and (4) Recent Developments and Distributional Estimators. We use recent empirical work to highlight and explain each method, and provide sources for researchers interested in further information on each topic.",F
"Brück, Tilman|Llussá, Fernanda|Tavares, José","Perceptions, Expectations, and Entrepreneurship: The Role of Extreme Events","We provide, for the first time, comparative evidence of the impact of various types of extreme events  natural disasters, terrorism, and violent conflicts  on the perceptions of entrepreneurs concerning some key entrepreneurial issues  such as fear of failure in starting a business venture, whether individuals expect that good opportunities are likely to emerge in the next six months, and the expected level of competition stemming from creating new ventures. The occurrence of extreme events is likely to be exogenous to the perceptions affecting it so that we can identify a causal link from events to entrepreneurs and their perceptions. Using individual-level data from 43 countries from the period 2002 to 2005, we find that neither indicator of the intensity of extreme events has a significant impact on entrepreneurial activity, when country characteristics are not controlled for. Once invariant country characteristics are taken into account, we find that Terrorist Attacks have a positive and significant impact on business creation, Natural Disasters have a positive and negative impact on entrepreneurial activity, and Violent Conflict has no significant effect. These results are consistent with differential impacts of extreme events on perception variables such as Fear of Failure, Expected Business Opportunities, and Expected Level of Competition.

There is hence scope for entrepreneurs, and policies supporting them, to create growth from the ruins of extreme events.",F

However, evidence for causal interpretation of this association is weak. We examine a causal relationship using two approaches for identification within the same 	data: cousins with twin parents and adopted children. We find no effect of mothers' education on children's school performance using the children-of-twins approach. However, for adopted children, mother's education has a small positive effect. Tracking the work experience of parents during offspring childhood, we find no support that this effect can be explained by a higher labor force participation among more educated mothers.",I

This paper investigates whether this fact may be led back to the intrinsic motivation of Protestants to read the bible and whether other education motives were involved as well. We employ a historical data set from Switzerland which allows us to differentiate between different cognitive 	skills: reading, numeracy, essay writing and Swiss history. We develop an estimation strategy to examine whether the impact of religious denomination was particularly large with respect to reading capabilities. We find support for this hypothesis. However, Protestants education motives went beyond reading the bible.",I
"Böckerman, Petri|Hämäläinen, Ulla|Uusitalo, Roope","Labour Market Effects of the Polytechnic Education Reform: The Finnish Experience","This paper evaluates the labour market effects of the introduction of the polytechnic education system in Finland. The polytechnic reform gradually transformed former vocational colleges into polytechnics. Since the timing of the reform differed across schools, we can compare the performance of polytechnic graduates to the performance of vocational college graduates controlling for both the year and the school effects. The results are somewhat sensitive to how the selectivity issues are treated but generally suggest that both the earnings and the employment levels of post-reform graduates are higher in the field of business and administration. The effects are much smaller and usually insignificant in other fields.",I
"Beine, Michel|Docquier, Frédéric|Rapoport, Hillel","On the Robustness of Brain Gain Estimates","Recent theoretical studies suggest that migration prospects can raise the expected return to human capital and thus foster education investment at home or, in other words, induce a brain gain. In a recent paper (Beine, Docquier and Rapoport, Economic Journal, 2008) we used the Docquier and Marfouk (2006) data set on emigration rates by education level to examine the impact of brain drain migration on gross (pre-migration) human capital formation in developing countries. We found a positive effect of skilled migration prospects on human capital growth in a cross-section of 127 developing countries, with an elasticity of about 5 percent. In this paper we assess the robustness of our results to the use of alternative brain drain measures, definitions of human capital, and functional forms. We find that the results hold using the Beine et al. (2007) alternative brain drain measures controlling for whether migrants acquired their skills in the home or in the host country. We also regress other indicators of human capital investment on skilled migration rates and find a positive effect on youth literacy while the effect on school enrolment depends on the exact specification chosen.",F
"Webber, Douglas A.|Ehrenberg, Ronald G.","Do Expenditures Other Than Instructional Expenditures Affect Graduation and Persistence Rates in American Higher Education?","Median instructional spending per full-time equivalent (FTE) student at American colleges and universities has grown at a slower rate the median spending per FTE in a number of other expenditure categories during the last two decades. We use institutional level panel data and a variety of econometric approaches, including unconditional quantile regression models, to analyze whether noninstructional expenditure categories influence first year persistence and graduation rates of American undergraduate students. Our most important finding is that student service expenditures influence graduation and persistence rates and their marginal effects are larger for students at institutions with lower entrance test scores and more lower income students. Put another way, their effects are largest at institutions that have lower current persistence and graduation rates. Simulations suggest that reallocating some funding from instruction to student services may enhance persistence and graduation rates at those institutions whose rates are currently below the medians in the sample.",I

"Howard, Larry L.|Prakash, Nishith","Do Means-Tested School Lunch Subsidies Change Children's Weekly Consumption Patterns?","This article examines whether the means-tested component of the National School Lunch Program changes beneficiaries' dietary patterns by taking advantage of variation across public school districts in the financing of and demand for lunch and nutrition programs. Using data on fifth grade public elementary school children in the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten (2003-2004), we find significant increases in weekly rates of consumption amongst fully and partially subsidized children. Our estimates also suggest that the increase was for items known to be a rich source of vitamins and minerals that are essential for children's health and development. The effects are larger for fully subsidized children relative to partially subsidized children, which suggests the nominal price of school lunch is a binding constraint for certain children on the margin of eligibility for the subsidies. To the extent that children from low-income households experience undernourishment with greater frequency, policy discussion focusing exclusively on the link between obesity and program participation is overlooking positive effects on those who are directly subsidized.",I
"Brücker, Herbert|Fachin, Stefano|Venturini, Alessandra","Do Foreigners Replace Native Immigrants? Evidence from a Panel Cointegration Analysis","This paper examines the impact of the immigration of foreigners on domestic labour mobility. Since David Card's seminal study on the regional labour market impact of the Mariel Boatlift it is controversial whether domestic labour mobility equilibrates economic conditions across cities and regions. However, there is little or no evidence that natives leave destinations where migrants tend to cluster. In this paper we reconcile the existing evidence by taking another route. We analyze whether the immigration of foreigners replaces domestic mobility from poor to rich regions. We focus on Italy, which is characterized by market differences in earnings between the North and the South. Based on a panel cointegration approach we exploit the variance of international and internal migration over time for identifying potential displacement effects. The main finding is that, conditional on unemployment and wage differentials, the share of foreign workers in the labour force of the destination regions discourages internal labour mobility significantly. As a consequence, spatial correlation studies which use the variance of the foreigner share across region for identifying the wage and employment effects of immigration, tend to understate the actual immigration impact.",F

The model is able to produce the decline in labor supply with age as well as the hump-shaped consumption profile. In both cases, health and health investment play a crucial role as the former encroaches upon healthy time and the latter crowds out non-medical expenditures as people age. Finally, we quantify the value of health as both an investment and a consumption good. We show that the investment motive is about three times higher than the consumption motive during the early 20s, but decreases over the life-cycle until it disappears at retirement. In contrast, the consumption motive increases with age and surpasses the investment motive during the mid 40s.",I

However, thus far researchers have focused on computing mean differences in student achievement between smaller and larger classes. In this study I focus on the distribution of the small class effects at the school level and compute the inconsistency of the treatment effects across schools. I use data from Project STAR and estimated small class effects for each school on mathematics and reading scores from kindergarten through third grade. The results revealed that school-specific small class effects are both positive and negative and that although students benefit considerably from being in small classes in some schools, in other schools being in small classes is a disadvantage. Small class effects were inconsistent and varied significantly across schools. Full time teacher aide effects were also inconsistent across schools and in some schools students benefit considerably from being in regular classes with a full time aide, while in other schools being in these classes is a disadvantage.",I

The benefits that are financed by taxation in one country may need to be purchased out of disposable income in another. We estimate the size and incidence of in kind or non cash benefits from public housing subsidies, education and health care for five European countries using comparable methods and data. Inequality in the augmented income measure is dramatically lower than in disposable income, with the effects of the three components varying in importance across countries. Adapting equivalence scales to take proper account of differences in needs for health care and education across population members reduces the scale of the effect, but does not eliminate it.",I
"Wagner, Joachim","Offshoring and Firm Performance: Self-Selection, Effects on Performance, or Both?","This paper uses unique new data for German manufacturing enterprises from matched regular surveys and a special purpose survey to investigate the causal effect of relocation of activities to a foreign country on various dimensions of firm performance. Enterprises that relocated activities abroad in the period 2001-03 for the first time are compared to firms that did not relocate activities abroad before 2006. The comparison is performed for both 2004 (to document differences between the two groups of firms after some of them started to relocate abroad) and for 2000 (when none of them did relocate abroad). It turns out that, compared to non-offshoring firms, firms that relocated activities were larger and more productive, and had a higher share of exports in total sales. All these differences existed in 2000, the year before some firms started to relocate, and this points to self-selection of better firms into offshoring. This finding is in line with results from recent theoretical models and with results from other countries. To investigate the causal effects of relocation across borders on firm performance, six different variants of a matching approach of firms that did and did not start to relocate abroad in 2001-03 were performed based on a propensity score estimated using firm characteristics in 2000 and the change in the performance variable between 1997 and 2000. The performance of both groups was compared for 2004-06 when some firms were relocating firms and the others were not. Broadly in line with hypotheses derived from the literature there is no evidence that offshoring has a negative causal impact on employment in offshoring firms. The effect is positive and large for productivity, and weak evidence for a positive effect on the wage per employee, the proxy variable for human capital intensity used, is found. Contrary to what is often argued, therefore, we find no evidence for a negative causal effect of offshoring on employment in Germany or on other core dimensions of firm performance.",F

We find that students are more likely to leave their school when poor school-level performance is revealed. In general, parents respond to information soon after it becomes available. Once the information is absorbed, they do not respond to subsequent releases, even when it is reframed and given widespread media attention. Parents in low-income neighborhoods and those who speak a non-English language at home respond most strongly. However, non-English speaking parents only respond when information is widely disseminated and discussed in the media.",I

Our findings extend existing work that documents such discontinuities only among private schools (Urquiola and Verhoogen, 2009). These discontinuities violate the assumptions underlying the regression discontinuity design, which are crucial for identification. Consequently, IV estimates of class size effects are likely to be seriously biased. Potential manipulation of the treatment assignment rule by public schools warrants caution in applying a regression discontinuity design to estimate class size effects and indicates that institutional context is crucial for its scope of applicability.",I

It is well known that private (i.e. fee-paying) schools compared to state schools score higher on most measures of school quality. Therefore by comparing individuals with private schooling to those with state schooling (and controlling for other variables) it is possible to indirectly evaluate the effect of school quality.

Their sequencing in relation to other policy goals such as financial sector reforms and exchange rate flexibility will affect their benefit-risk tradeoffs. We describe the measures taken and progress attained in each of these areas, and discuss the implications of these changes for the balance and sustainability of China's own economic development as well as the associated implications for the global monetary system. While China is actively promoting the internationalization of its currency, it is a long way from attaining full convertibility or meeting other prerequisites for achieving reserve currency status. Ultimately, China will proceed with capital account convertibility in its own controlled and gradual manner, with the goal being an open capital account but with significant administrative and other soft controls. The renminbi will play an increasingly important role in the international monetary system but is unlikely to displace the U.S. dollar anytime soon.",F
"Frederiksen, Anders|Lange, Fabian|Kriechel, Ben","Subjective Performance Evaluations and Employee Careers","Firms commonly use supervisor ratings to evaluate employees when objective performance measures are unavailable. Supervisor ratings are subjective and data containing supervisor ratings typically stem from individual firm level data sets. For both these reasons, doubts persist on how useful such data are for evaluating theories in personnel economics and whether findings from such data generalize to the labor force at large. In this paper, we examine personnel data from six large companies and establish how subjective ratings, interpreted as ordinal rankings of employees within narrowly defined peer-groups, correlate with objective career outcomes. We find many similarities across firms in how subjective ratings correlate with earnings, base pay, bonuses, promotions, demotions, separations, quits and dismissals and cautiously propose these as empirical regularities.",M

This paper analyzes how welfare states achieve insurance and equity objectives for residents who work in other countries. The aim is to evaluate the impact of unemployment benefits and income taxation on these frontier workers' welfare in Luxembourg and Belgium that exhibit similar welfare state objectives. The analysis is based on social security coordination Regulation 883/2004 provisions on unemployment, taxation regimes and bi-lateral tax treaties. We find mixed results. First, while countries follow analogous welfare regimes and pursue similar welfare objectives, their ensuing outputs differ significantly. Second, differences in unemployment conditions and benefits favor high discrepancies in residents' incomes. Third, mobility creates high vertical and horizontal inequity among Belgian and Luxembourgish residents.",I

In dozens of countries, and for a large range of well-being measures, including happiness and mental health, well-being is high in youth, falls to a nadir in midlife, and rises again in old age. The reasons for this U-shape are still unclear. Present theories emphasize sociological and economic forces. In this study we show that a similar U-shape exists in 508 great apes (two samples of chimpanzees and one sample of orangutans) whose well-being was assessed by keepers familiar with the individual apes. This U-shaped pattern or midlife crisis emerges with or without use of parametric methods. Our results imply that human well-beings curved shape is not uniquely human and that, while it may be partly explained by aspects of human life and society, its origins may lie partly in the biology we share with closely related great apes. These findings have implications across scientific and social-scientific disciplines and potentially in identifying ways to enhance the well-being of humans and apes.",I

Evidence from Matched Current Population Surveys and the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997","Nearly twenty million children in the United States do not have computers in their homes. The role of home computers in the educational process, however, has drawn very little attention in the previous literature. We use panel data from the two main U.S. datasets that include recent information on computer ownership among children  the 2000-2003 CPS Computer and Internet Use Supplements (CIUS) matched to the CPS Basic Monthly Files and the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997  to explore the relationship between computer ownership and high school graduation and other educational outcomes. Teenagers who have access to home computers are 6 to 8 percentage points more likely to graduate from high school than teenagers who do not have home computers after controlling for individual, parental, and family characteristics. We generally find evidence of positive relationships between home computers and educational outcomes using several estimation strategies, including controlling for typically unobservable home environment and extracurricular activities in the NLSY97, fixed effects models, instrumental variables, future computer ownership and pencil tests. Some of these estimation techniques, however, provide imprecise estimates.

Using a two-stage sequential decision model to analyze the initial enrollment intensity decision jointly with attrition, we find no evidence of correlation in the unobservables that necessitates joint estimation, but substantial evidence that the factors associated with attrition differ by initial enrollment status. The timing of initial enrollment, academic performance, parental education, household characteristics, and economic factors had a substantially greater impact on those initially enrolled full-time, while racial and ethnic characteristics had a greater impact on those initially enrolled part-time.

However, grade-based eligibility and retention rules encourage other behavioral responses. Using data extracted from the longitudinal records of all undergraduates who enrolled at the University of Georgia (UGA) between 1989 and 1997, we estimate the effects of HOPE on college GPA, course selection, and major choice, treating non-residents as a control group. First, we find that HOPE increased resident freshman GPA by 0.13 point, while its effect on GPA after the first year is weak. Second, HOPE reduced the number of credit hours completed in math and science core curriculum courses during the first year, and this effect persisted into the second at roughly the same magnitude. Over both years, the estimated program effects imply that residents completed about 1.2 fewer math and sciences credit hours. Finally, the likelihood that the average resident freshman would choose to major in Education jumped 1.2 percentage points relative to their out-of-state counterparts after HOPE was introduced and the scholarship's influence on this decision was more pronounced for women and whites.",I
"Cornwell, Christopher|Mustard, David B.","Merit Aid and Sorting: The Effects of HOPE-Style Scholarships on College Ability Stratification","In the last fifteen years there has been a significant increase in merit aid. Coincident with this increase in merit aid has been increased attention to sorting in various aspects of life, especially in education. This paper examines the extent to which merit-based aid exacerbates or ameliorates sorting by ability in higher education. We use panel data from Petersons Guide to Colleges and the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) to evaluate this relationship. Our difference-in-differences estimates show that HOPE increased the quality of entering freshmen in Georgia institutions relative to their out-of-state peers. At the highest-quality institutions HOPE raised all measures of student quality and the homogeneity of students by ability. The lowest-quality institutions experienced no statistically significant effect from HOPE on any measure of student quality. We conclude that state-sponsored merit aid programs increased the retention of high ability students for college and also increased the ability stratification of institutions within states.  We also examined two indirect measures of student selectivity-acceptance and yield rates. HOPE decreases acceptance rates at all types of institutions, but the percentage change is largest at the universities, which are most space constrained. HOPE increased yield rates for universities but not for any other institution categories. Together these results suggest that HOPE substantially increased the selectivity at universities.",I

In an extended Roy-model we analyse the factors which affect the selection bias of migrants. In particular, we find that migrants need not necessarily be (un-)favourably self-selected if the inequality of earnings is higher (lower) in the receiving country compared to the sending country. Moreover, migrants might be favourably (self-)selected if the migration costs tend to decline with the skill level of migrants, even if the inequality of earnings is larger in the destination relative to the sending country. Based on a novel data set we find descriptive evidence that migrants tend be positively (self-)selected although the inequality in earnings is higher in the sending relative to the receiving countries. Moreover, our regressions results indicate that both, a higher inequality in the host and the home country, is associated with a favourable selection bias.",F

Results based on social multipliers (Glaeser et al. 2000, 2003) suggest that both native-to-native and migrant-to-migrant peer effects are higher in ability-differencing school systems than in comprehensive schools. Thus, non-comprehensive school systems seem to magnify the already existing educational inequality between students with a low parental socioeconomic migration background and children from more privileged families.

"Adda, Jérôme|Cornaglia, Francesca","The Effect of Taxes and Bans on Passive Smoking","This paper evaluates the effect of excise taxes and bans on smoking in public places on the exposure to tobacco smoke of non-smokers. We use a novel way of quantifying passive 	smoking: we use data on cotinine concentration  a metabolite of nicotine  measured in a large population of non-smokers over time. Exploiting state and time variation across US states, we show that excise taxes have a significant effect on passive smoking but smoking bans have contrasting effects on non-smokers. While bans in public transportation or in schools decrease the exposure of non smokers, bans in recreational public places perversely increase their exposure by displacing smokers to private places where they contaminate non smokers, and in particular young children. Bans affect socio-economic groups differently: we find that smoking bans increase the exposure of poorer individuals, while it decreases the exposure of richer individuals.",I

The logic of school reform suggests two frameworks with which to judge the importance of effects. One is the size of the existing achievement gaps between important groups in society. The other is the size of gaps in mean achievement among schools (adjusted for student characteristics). NAEP data is used to demonstrate that in national data, gaps which appear large by one standard may appear small by the other. We argue that the most appropriate framework for judging reform effects is the national distribution of school effects.",I

Our results indicate that the published progress rates are substantially higher than the progress rates for the unreported populations.

"Banks, James|Marmot, Michael|Oldfield, Zoë|Smith, James P.","The SES Health Gradient on Both Sides of the Atlantic","Looking across many diseases, average health among mature men is much worse in America compared to England. Second, there exists a steep negative health gradient for men in both countries where men at the bottom of the economic hierarchy are in much worse health than those at the top. This health gradient exists whether education, income, or financial wealth is used as the marker of ones SES status. These conclusions are maintained even after controlling for a standard set of behavioral risk factors such as smoking, drinking, and obesity and are equally true using either biological measures of disease or individual self-reports. In contrast to these disease based measures, health of American men appears to be superior to the health of English men when self-reported general health status is used. The contradiction most likely stems instead from different thresholds used by Americans and English when evaluating health status on subjective scales. For the same objective health status, Americans are much more likely to say that their health is good than are the English. Finally, feedbacks from new health events to household income are one of the reasons that underlie the strength of the income gradient with health in England.",I
"Rablen, Matthew D.|Oswald, Andrew J.","Mortality and Immortality","It has been known for centuries that the rich and famous have longer lives than the poor and ordinary. Causality, however, remains trenchantly debated. The ideal experiment would be one in which status and money could somehow be dropped upon a sub-sample of individuals while those in a control group received neither. This paper attempts to formulate a test in that spirit. It collects 19th-century birth data on science Nobel Prize winners and nominees. Using a variety of corrections for potential biases, the paper concludes that winning the Nobel Prize, rather than merely being nominated, is associated with between 1 and 2 years of extra longevity. Greater wealth, as measured by the real value of the Prize, does not seem to affect lifespan.",I
"Maurin, Eric|McNally, Sandra","Educational Effects of Widening Access to the Academic Track: A Natural Experiment","It is difficult to know whether widening access to schools which provide a more academically oriented general education makes a difference to average educational achievement. We make use of reforms affecting admission to the high ability track in Northern Ireland, but not England. The comparison of educational outcomes between Northern Ireland and England before and after the reform identifies the net effect of expanding the academic track to accommodate more students. This is composed of the direct effect of the more academic track on individual performance and the indirect effect arising on account of the change in peer group composition. Our paper is relevant to debate on the consequences of ability tracking and of expanding access to the academic track.",I

"Neuman, Einat|Neuman, Shoshana","Agency in Health-Care: Are Medical Care-Givers Perfect Agents?","It has been suggested in the literature that a source of incompleteness in the agency relationship between the doctor and the patient is that the provider may respond to an incomplete or biased perception of the patients interests. However, this has not been shown empirically. This paper is novel in presenting an empirical test of the fundamental assumption of the agency model that health care professionals understand what their patients want. Discrete Choice Experiments (DCEs) are conducted simultaneously within samples of patients (women who gave birth) and care-givers (doctors and nurses), to elicit and contrast patients authentic preferences (for five maternity ward attributes) with what care-givers believe them to be. 	Conclusion: agents have a biased perception of principals preferences, and therefore a complete agency relationship does not exist. Our findings add a novel empirical contribution to the agency relationship literature. Moreover, parallel preference patterns of patients and care-givers are certainly of much interest to the field of health economics: Informing the unaware medical care-givers about the patients' preferences, will improve treatment and patients' satisfaction.",I
"Mitra, Devashish|Ranjan, Priya","Offshoring and Unemployment","In this paper, in order to study the impact of offshoring on sectoral and economywide rates of unemployment, we construct a two sector general equilibrium model in which labor is mobile across the two sectors, and unemployment is caused by search frictions. We find that, contrary to general perception, wage increases and sectoral unemployment decreases due to offshoring. This result can be understood to arise from the productivity enhancing (cost reducing) effect of offshoring. If the search cost is identical in the two sectors, or even if the search cost is higher in the sector which experiences offshoring, the economywide rate of unemployment decreases. We also find multiple equilibrium outcomes in the extent of offshoring and therefore, in the unemployment rate. Furthermore, a firm can increase its domestic employment through offshoring. Also, such a firm's domestic employment can be higher than a firm that chooses to remain fully domestic. When we modify the model to disallow intersectoral labor mobility, the negative relative price effect on the sector in which firms offshore some of their activity becomes stronger. In such a case, it is possible for this effect to offset the positive productivity effect, and result in a rise in unemployment in that sector. In the other sector, offshoring has a much stronger unemployment reducing effect in the absence of intersectoral labor mobility than in the presence of it. Finally, allowing for an endogenous number of varieties provides an additional indirect channel, through which sectoral unemployment goes down due to the entry of new firms brought about by offshoring.",F

"Konstantopoulos, Spyros","How Long Do Teacher Effects Persist?","Previous findings from experimental and non-experimental studies have demonstrated that teachers differ in their effectiveness. In addition, evidence from non-experimental studies has indicated that teacher effects can last up to five years. This study used high-quality data from a four-year randomized experiment in which teachers and students were randomly assigned to classes to examine whether teacher effects on student achievement persist over time. Teacher effects are defined as teacher specific residuals adjusted for student and treatment effects. Findings indicate that the teacher effects are cumulative and observed not only in the current or the following grade, but they endure up to three years in early elementary grades. The findings also suggest that teacher effects are important and their additive effects on student achievement are as large as the additive effects of small classes. Finally, teacher effects are larger in reading than in mathematics.",I
"Konstantopoulos, Spyros","Do Small Classes Reduce the Achievement Gap between Low and High Achievers? Evidence from Project STAR","Given that previous findings on the social distribution of the effects of small classes have been mixed and inconclusive, in the present study I attempted to shed light on the mechanism through which small classes affect the achievement of low- and high-achieving students. I used data from a 4-year large-scale randomized experiment (project STAR) to examine the effects of small classes on the achievement gap. The sample consisted of nearly 11,000 elementary school students who participated in the experiment from kindergarten to grade 3. Meta-analysis and quantile regression methods were employed to examine the effects of small classes on the achievement gap in mathematics and reading SAT scores. The results consistently indicated that higher-achieving students benefited more from being in small classes in early grades than other students. The findings also indicated that although all types of students benefited from being in small classes, reductions in class size did not reduce the achievement gap between low and high achievers.",I

This paper studies academic entrepreneurs using a comprehensive venture capital database. I find that about two-thirds of the academic entrepreneurs locate their businesses in the same state as their universities. National academy membership and number of faculty awards, measures of a universitys research quality, are the most significant variables in explaining the number of academic entrepreneurs from a university. In contrast, the abundance of venture capital near the university has no significant effect on academic entrepreneurship.",M

We estimate a number of duration of life models that control for unobserved household heterogeneity. Our results confirm that childhood conditions such as household income and the quality of the home environment are significant predictors of longevity. Importantly, however, the role of socio-economic status appears to differ across cause of death, with household income only being a significant predictor of death from cancer. Moreover, we find that children born in a location with relatively high infant mortality rates live significantly fewer years, that 1st born children in the family live significantly more years, and that there is a very high correlation in longevity across children from the same family across all causes of death. We estimate that the difference in life expectancy between good and bad households is as large as 11 years.",I
"Humlum, Maria Knoth|Kleinjans, Kristin J.|Nielsen, Helena Skyt","An Economic Analysis of Identity and Career Choice","Standard economic models which focus on pecuniary payoffs cannot explain why there are highly able individuals who choose careers with low pecuniary returns. Therefore, financial incentives are unlikely to be effective in influencing career choices of these individuals. Based on Akerlof and Kranton (2000), we consider a model of career choice and identity where individuals derive non-pecuniary identity payoffs. Using factor analysis on a range of attitude questions, we find two factors related to identity (career orientation and social orientation), which are important for educational choices. The implication is that policymakers and institutions of higher education need to focus on identity related issues rather than just improved financial incentives if they aim at attracting the high ability youth to occupations with excess demand for labor.",I

Correcting for important biases that plague previous calculations, we establish that (a) the true high school graduation rate is substantially lower than the official rate issued by the National Center for Educational Statistics; (b) it has been declining over the past 40 years; (c) majority/minority graduation rate differentials are substantial and have not converged over the past 35 years; (d) the decline in high school graduation rates occurs among native populations and is not solely a consequence of increasing proportions of immigrants and minorities in American society; (e) the decline in high school graduation explains part of the recent slowdown in college attendance; and (f) the pattern of the decline of high school graduation rates by gender helps to explain the recent increase in male-female college attendance gaps.",I
"Bertola, Giuseppe|Checchi, Daniele|Oppedisano, Veruska","Private School Quality in Italy","We discuss how a schooling systems structure may imply that private school enrolment leads to worse subsequent performance in further education or in the labour market, and we seek evidence of such phenomena in Italian data. If students differ not only in terms of their families ability to pay but also in terms of their own ability to take advantage of educational opportunities (talent for short), theory predicts that private schools attract a worse pool of students when publicly funded schools are better suited to foster progress by more talented students. We analyze empirically three surveys of Italian secondary school graduates, interviewed 3 year after graduation. In these data, the impact of observable talent proxies on educational and labour market outcomes is indeed more positive for students who (endogenously) choose to attend public schools than for those who choose to pay for private education.",I

In this paper we utilize unique student-level data from the Texas Schools Microdata Panel (TSMP) in an attempt to determine what factors contribute to the higher minority dropout rates. We show that poverty is a key contributor. Lack of English proficiency among Hispanic student is linked to the higher Hispanic dropout probability. Our results also suggest that neighborhood characteristics may be important in explaining the high African-American dropout rates. We also address the issue of the surprisingly low official dropout rates reported by the Texas Education Agency (TEA) and show that the GED program explains some of the discrepancy.",I
"Bandyopadhyay, Subhayu|Marjit, Sugata|Yang, Lei","An Evaluation of the Employment Effects of Barriers to Outsourcing","Barriers to outsourcing that are being currently implemented in the US effectively tax its companies who export jobs through outsourcing. The objective is to raise domestic employment. Given that many of the important international markets where the US has a comparative advantage feature non-atomistic firms, we evaluate the implications of such policies in an oligopolistic context. We find that while an outsourcing tax favors domestic workers by causing firms to switch to a greater use of domestic sources (the substitution effect), the loss in international competitiveness has a negative volume effect (the output effect), which pulls in the other direction. First, we identify the conditions that determine the relative strengths of these effects, which inform us about the conditions under which such a tax achieves its stated objective. Next, we consider the international policy interdependence that arises when a competing nation also engages in such a policy. An interesting finding is that even if a unilateral tax by the US raises its employment, this may turn around in a Nash policy equilibrium, where the competing nation abandons free trade and also engages in unilateral outsourcing policies. Finally, we extend the basic model to look at the effects of credit shortage and product differentiation. Interesting findings are that both a credit crisis (as in recent years) and increased product differentiation tend to worsen the employment effects of the outsourcing tax. The qualitative nature of our findings is similar between Cournot and Bertrand competition, suggesting that our results are robust to the mode of strategic behavior.",F

Using rich administrative data on benefit receipt histories and a selection on observed variables identification strategy, we find that the program modestly reduces benefit receipt among participants. Methodologically, we highlight the importance of flexibly conditioning on benefit histories, as well as taking account of complex sample designs when applying matching methods. We find that survey measures of attitudes add information beyond that contained in the benefit histories and that incorporating the insights of the recent literature on dynamic treatment effects matters even when not formally applying the related methods. Finally, we explain why our results differ substantially from those of the official evaluation of NDLP, which found very large impacts on benefit exits.",I
"Leuven, Edwin|Oosterbeek, Hessel","Overeducation and Mismatch in the Labor Market","This paper surveys the economics literature on overeducation. The original motivation to study this topic were reports that the strong increase in the number of college graduates in the early 1970s in the US led to a decrease in the returns to college education. We argue that Duncan and Hoffmans augmented wage equation  the workhorse model in the overeducation literature  in which wages are regressed on years of overschooling, years of required schooling and years of underschooling is at best loosely related to this original motivation. We discuss measurement and estimation issues and give an overview of the main empirical findings in this literature. Finally we given an appraisal of the economic lessons learned.",I
"Braga, Michela|Paccagnella, Marco|Pellizzari, Michele","Evaluating Students' Evaluations of Professors","This paper contrasts measures of teacher effectiveness with the students' evaluations for the same teachers using administrative data from Bocconi University (Italy). The effectiveness measures are estimated by comparing the subsequent performance in follow-on coursework of students who are randomly assigned to teachers in each of their compulsory courses. We find that, even in a setting where the syllabuses are fixed and all teachers in the same course present exactly the same material, teachers still matter substantially. The average difference in subsequent performance between students who were assigned to the best and worst teacher (on the effectiveness scale) is approximately 43% of a standard deviation in the distribution of exam grades, corresponding to about 5.6% of the average grade. Additionally, we find that our measure of teacher effectiveness is negatively correlated with the students' 	evaluations: in other words, teachers who are associated with better subsequent performance receive worst evaluations from their students. We rationalize these results with a simple model where teachers can either engage in real teaching or in teaching-to-the-test, the former requiring higher students effort than the latter. Teaching-to-the-test guarantees high grades in the current course but does not improve future outcomes. Hence, if students are myopic and evaluate better teachers from which they derive higher utility in a static framework, the model is capable of predicting our empirical finding that good teachers receive bad evaluations, especially when teaching-to-the-test is very effective (for example, with multiple choice tests). Consistently with the predictions of the model, we also find that classes in which high skill students are over-represented produce evaluations that are less at odds with estimated teacher effectiveness.",I

Respondents appear to be aware of some of the qualitative relationships between risk factors and probabilities. However, on average they have very poor perceptions of the absolute probability levels as reported in the epidemiological literature. Perceptions are less accurate if a respondent is female and has no college degree. Perceived probabilities significantly affect the subsequent take-up rate of flu shots and mammograms.",I

Descriptive statistics and regression analysis (with and without controlling for unobserved firm heterogeneity and the role of outliers) point to the absence of any statistically significant and economically large effects of trade activities on profits. This demonstrates that any productivity advantages of trading firms are eaten up by extra costs related to selling and buying on foreign markets.",F
"Goeree, Michelle S.|Ham, John C.|Iorio, Daniela","Race, Social Class, and Bulimia Nervosa","In this paper we explore a serious eating disorder, bulimia nervosa (BN), which afflicts a surprising number of girls in the US. We challenge the long-held belief that BN primarily affects high income White teenagers, using a unique data set on adolescent females evaluated regarding their tendencies towards bulimic behaviors independent of any diagnoses or treatment they have received. Our results reveal that African Americans are more likely to exhibit bulimic behavior than Whites; as are girls from low income families compared to middle and high income families. We use another data set to show that who is diagnosed with an eating disorder is in accord with popular beliefs, suggesting that African American and low-income girls are being under-diagnosed for BN. Our findings have important implications for public policy since they provide direction to policy makers regarding which adolescent females are most at risk for BN. Our results are robust to different model specifications and identifying assumptions.",I
"Dearden, Lorraine|Micklewright, John|Vignoles, Anna","The Effectiveness of English Secondary Schools for Pupils of Different Ability Levels","'League table' information on school effectiveness in England generally relies on either a comparison of the average outcomes of pupils by school, e.g. mean exam scores, or on estimates of the average value added by each school. These approaches assume that the information parents and policy-makers need most to judge school effectiveness is the average achievement level or gain in a particular school. Yet schools can be differentially effective for children with differing levels of prior attainment. We present evidence on the extent of differential effectiveness in English secondary schools, and find that even the most conservative estimate suggests that around one quarter of schools in England are differentially effective for students of differing prior ability levels. This affects an even larger proportion of children as larger schools are more likely to be differentially effective.",I

The focus is on the empirical part of the literature that consists of recently published papers using data for firms from manufacturing or services industries to study the links between international trade (exports and imports) and dimensions of firm performance (productivity, wages, profitability and survival).

Pupils in mixed grade classrooms are found to outperform pupils in single grade classrooms on high stake central exit tests and teacher set and graded tests. This effect is driven by pupils benefiting from sharing the classroom with more mature peers from higher grades. The presence of lower grade peers is detrimental for achievement. Pupils can therefore benefit from de-tracking by grade, but the effects depend crucially on how the classroom is balanced in terms of lower and higher grades. These results reconcile the contradictory findings in the literature.",I

It contributes to the literature by providing the first evidence on the role of imports and two-way trading for firm survival in a highly developed country.

"Konstantopoulos, Spyros|Sun, Min","Is the Persistence of Teacher Effects in Early Grades Larger for Lower-Performing Students?","We examined the persistence of teacher effects from grade to grade on lower-performing students using high-quality experimental data from Project STAR, where students and teachers were assigned randomly to classrooms of different sizes. The data included information about mathematics and reading scores and student demographics such as gender, race, and SES. Teacher effects were computed as residual classroom achievement within schools and within grades. Then, teacher effects were used as predictors of achievement in following grades and quantile regression was used to estimate their persistence. Results consistently indicated that all students benefited similarly from teachers. Overall, systematic differential teacher effects were not observed and it appears that lower-performing students benefit as much as other students from teachers. In fourth grade there was some evidence that lower-performing students benefit more from effective teachers. Results from longitudinal analyses suggested that having effective teachers in successive grades is beneficial to all students and to lower-performing students in particular in mathematics. However, having low-effective teachers in successive grades is detrimental to all students and to lower-performing students in particular in reading.",I
"Keslair, Francois|Maurin, Eric|McNally, Sandra","Every Child Matters? An Evaluation of Special Educational Needs Programmes in England","The need for education to help every child rather than focus on average attainment has become a more central part of the policy agenda in the US and the UK. Remedial programmes are often difficult to evaluate because participation is usually based on pupil characteristics that are largely unobservable to the analyst. In this paper we evaluate programmes for children with moderate levels of 'special educational needs' in England. We show that the decentralized design of the policy generates significant variations in access to remediation resources across children with similar prior levels of difficulty. However, this differential is not reflected in subsequent educational attainment  suggesting that the programme is ineffective for 'treated' children. In the second part of our analysis, we use demographic variation within schools to consider the effect of the programme on whole year groups. Our analysis is consistent with no overall effect on account of the combined direct and indirect (spillover) effects. Thus, the analysis suggests that a key way that English education purports to help children with learning difficulties is not working.",I

We constructed a dataset of relevant reforms occurred at the national level over the last century, and match individual information to the most likely set-up faced when individual educational choices were undertaken. Thus our identification strategy relies on temporal and geographical variations in the institutional arrangements, controlling for time/country fixed effects, as well as for confounding factors. We also explore who are the individual most likely affected by the reforms. We also group different reforms in order to ascertain the prevailing attitudes of policy makers, showing that reforms can belong to either inclusive or selective in their nature. Finally we correlate these attitudes to political coalitions prevailing in parliament, finding support to the idea that left wing parties support reforms that are inclusive in nature, while right wing parties prefer selective ones.",I

We test this hypothesis by conducting the largest-ever field experiment involving the random provision of free computers for home use to students. 1,123 schoolchildren grades 6-10 in 15 California schools participated in the experiment. Although the program significantly increased computer ownership and use, we find no effects on any educational outcomes, including grades, standardized test scores, credits earned, attendance and disciplinary actions.

The estimated null effect is consistent with survey evidence showing no change in homework time or other intermediate inputs in education for treatment students.",I

The implications are two-fold.  First, the returns to noncognitive traits may be highly context-dependent.  Second, policy discussion concerning educational inequality should include, not just the possibilities for remediating the skill levels of poor children, but also approaches to changing the environments that limit their opportunities.",I

We combine self-reported data on hunger experiences from SHARELIFE, a retrospective survey conducted as part of SHARE in Europe in 2009, with administrative data on food supply (caloric rations) in post-war Germany. The data suggest that individual behavior is a pathway between early life shocks and adult 	health: We find that those who experienced hunger spend a larger fraction of income on food. Taken together, our results confirm that in addition to the well-documented biological channel from early life circumstances to adult health, there is also a behavioral pathway.",I

Evidence from China's Academician Election","The impact of socio-economic status on health has been widely recognized, but the independent impact of social status alone on health remains inconclusive. We approach this challenge by exploiting a natural experiment in which subjects undergo a shift in their social status without considerable economic impact. We gather data on 4190 scientists who were either nominated for or successfully elected to the Chinese Academy of Science or of Engineering. Being elected as an academician in China is a boost in social status (vice-ministerial level) with negligible economic impact (US$30 monthly before 2009). After correcting for two sources of 	bias: 1) Some potential academicians decease too young to be elected, leading to immortal-time bias in favor of academicians and 2) the endogenous relationship between health and social status, we find that the enhanced social status of becoming an academician leads to approximately 1.2-years longer life.",I

University dropout is regularly discussed as a negative indicator. However, research on actual career trajectory of dropout students is virtually non-existent. Using data from the 2011 Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC) this study first compares the percentage of adults with tertiary dropout experience between European countries. Second, we examine whether tertiary dropout is a permanent decision as a considerable part of the literature assumes. In a third step, we investigate characteristics of adults with dropout experience. Finally, we estimate the effect of dropout on employment status and success of entering prestigious professions comparing results of logistic regression analysis and propensity score matching taking individuals characteristics like socio-economic and demographic background, work experience and cognitive skills into account.",I

The study performs a discrete duration model to account for individual and parental background and neighbourhood conditions. Subsequently, the size of explained variance in the home ownership gap between Dutch and ethnic minority groups is estimated using the Oaxaca-Fairlie non-linear decomposition method. The analysis indicates that the home ownership gap is the highest for Moroccans (0.07) of which only 0.042 is explained by the observed characteristics. For Turkish residents, 0.043 of the total 0.046 gap is explained by their background characteristics. The estimated transition rate to home ownership for Surinamese migrants would have been slightly higher than for Dutch residents if they had the same characteristics as Dutch residents. Western migrants have the smallest gap (0.024), of which 0.021 is explained by their observed characteristics.",R

However, the literature has not been able to document a strong causal relationship between imports and the wage gap. Instead, past studies have attributed the widening wage gap to skill biased technological change.",F
"Girma, Sourafel|Gong, Yundan|Görg, Holger|Lancheros, Sandra","Estimating Direct and Indirect Effects of Foreign Direct Investment on Firm Productivity in the Presence of Interactions between Firms","We implement a method to estimate the direct effects of foreign-ownership on foreign firms' productivity and the indirect effects (or spillovers) from the presence of foreign-owned firms on other foreign and domestic firms' productivity in a unifying framework, taking interactions between firms into account. To do so, we relax a fundamental assumption made in empirical studies examining a direct causal effect of foreign ownership on firm productivity, namely that of no interactions between firms. Based on our approach, we are able to combine direct and indirect effects of foreign ownership and calculate the total effect of foreign firms on local productivity. Our results show that all these effects vary with the level of foreign presence within a cluster, an important finding for the academic literature and policy debate on the benefits of attracting foreign owned firms.",F
"McGuigan, Martin|McNally, Sandra|Wyness, Gill","Student Awareness of Costs and Benefits of Educational Decisions: Effects of an Information Campaign and Media Exposure","University fees have recently trebled in England, prompting fears that young people may be put off from participating in higher education. We investigate students' knowledge and their receptiveness to information campaigns about the costs and benefits of staying on in education. We compare the effects of a specially designed information campaign to the effects of media exposure about the increase in tuition fees. The latter has a stronger effect on relevant outcomes. However, we find that an inexpensive information campaign can be effective in improving information and reducing perceived financial barriers to university participation, especially for students from disadvantaged backgrounds.",I
"Lee, Wang-Sheng","Is the BMI a Relic of the Past?","The most widely used measure of adiposity is to express weight adjusted for height using the body mass index (BMI). However, its limitations such as its inability to distinguish muscle weight from fat weight are well known, leading public health authorities in the UK and US to recommend measuring waist circumference as a complementary diagnostic tool for obesity. Recent attention placed on the syndrome referred to as 'normal weight obesity'  individuals with normal BMI but high body fat content  emphasizes the need for a more comprehensive diagnostic tool for obesity. Based on the NHANES III data, we utilize a semi-parametric spline approach to depict graphically the relationship between BMI, waist circumference and percent body fat. In this note, we propose that percent body fat charts that incorporate information from three anthropometric dimensions supersede the one-size-fits-all obesity diagnostic approach based on power-type indices such as the BMI.",I

Is there systematic evidence that this would positively affect firms' productivity, sales, employment or profits? To address these questions we assemble a unique dataset that matches all labor condition applications (LCAs)  the first step towards H-1B visas for skilled foreign-born workers in the U.S.  with firm-level data on publicly traded U.S. firms (from Compustat). Our identification is based on the sharp reduction in the annual H-1B cap that took place in 2004, combined with information on the degree of dependency on H-1B visas at the firm level as in Kerr and Lincoln (2010).",F

We use the universe of Canadian mortality records to document that Canada's Minimum Legal Drinking Age (MLDA) significantly reduces mortality rates of young men but has much smaller effects on women. Using drinking data that are far more detailed than in prior work, we document that the MLDA substantially reduces 'extreme' drinking among men but not women. Our results suggest that alcohol control efforts targeting young adults should focus on reducing extreme drinking behavior.",I

"Giuntella, Osea|Han, Wei|Mazzonna, Fabrizio","Circadian Rhythms, Sleep and Cognitive Skills: Evidence from an Unsleeping Giant","This paper analyzes the effects of sleep duration on cognitive skills and depression symptoms of older workers in China. Cognitive skills and mental health have been associated with sleep duration and are known to be strongly related to economic behavior and performance. However, causal evidence is lacking and little is known about sleep deprivation in developing countries. We exploit the relationship between circadian rhythms and bedtime to identify the effects of sleep using sunset time as an instrument. Using the Chinese Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study, we show that a later sunset time reduces significantly sleep duration and that sleep duration increases cognitive skills and eases depression symptoms of workers aged over 45 years. The results are driven by employed individuals living in urban areas, who are more likely to be constrained by rigid working schedules. On the contrary, we find no evidence of significant effects on self-employed and farmers.",I
"Wang, Kurt|Sabia, Joseph J.|Cesur, Resul","Sleepwalking through School: New Evidence on Sleep and Academic Performance","Policymakers advocating for later school starting times argue that increased sleep duration may generate important schooling benefits. Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, this study examines the relationship between sleep duration and academic performance, while carefully controlling for difficult-to-measure characteristics at the family- and individual-levels. We find that increased sleep time is associated with improvements in classroom concentration as well as increased educational attainment. However, we also find evidence of diminishing returns to increased sleep. We estimate an academic optimum number of sleep hours of, on average, 8.5 hours per night. Turning to sleep quality, we find that the onset of insomnia-like symptoms is associated with diminished contemporaneous academic concentration, but little change in longer-run educational attainment.",I

To do this, my focus is on research that identifies causal effects. Second, it tries to identify some of the big open research questions and policy knowledge gaps in this field.",I
"Gershenson, Seth","Should Value-Added Models Control for Student Absences?","Whether or not value-added models should control for contemporaneous student absences is theoretically ambiguous, as such absences are only partly outside of teachers' control. Teachers often feel strongly that value-added models should account for student attendance, and many districts' value-added models condition on lagged student absences as a result. Using matched teacher-student administrative data from a state-wide longitudinal data system, this note investigates the practical importance of this modeling decision for value-added measures of teacher effectiveness (VAMs). This is done by comparing VAM-based rankings of teacher effectiveness generated by value-added models that either control for current absences, control for lagged absences, or exclude student absences altogether.",I

We find evidence in both data sources that women faculty perform significantly more service than men, controlling for rank, race/ethnicity, and field or department.

Children in the treatment group are more likely to report having a social networking site, but also report spending more time communicating with their friends and interacting with their friends in person. There is no evidence that computer ownership displaces participation in after-school activities such as sports teams or clubs or reduces school participation and engagement.",I

The first method is based on a maximum class size rule in the spirit Angrist and Lavy (1999). The second method exploits population variation as first proposed by Hoxby (2000). The results of both methods (and of variations on these methods) are very similar and cannot reject that the class size effect is equal to zero. The estimates are very precise; we can rule out effects as small as 1.5 percent of a standard deviation for a one student change in class size during three years in a row.",I

The key advantage of our data is that we are able to identify these events on a quarterly basis rather than on the yearly basis used by previous studies. We find evidence that life events are not randomly distributed, that individuals to a large extent anticipate major events and that they quickly adapt. These effects have important implications for the calculation of monetary values needed to compensate individuals for life events such as crime or death of spouse. We find that our new valuation methodology that incorporates these dynamic factors produces considerably smaller compensation valuations than those calculated using the standard approach.",I
"Konstantopoulos, Spyros","Incorporating Cost in Power Analysis for Three-Level Cluster Randomized Designs","In experimental designs with nested structures entire groups (such as schools) are often assigned to treatment conditions. Key aspects of the design in these cluster randomized experiments include knowledge of the intraclass correlation structure and the sample sizes necessary to achieve adequate power to detect the treatment effect. However, the units at each level of the hierarchy have a cost associated with them and thus researchers need to decide on sample sizes given a certain budget, when designing their studies. This paper provides methods for computing power within an optimal design framework (that incorporates costs of units in all three levels) for three-level cluster randomized balanced designs with two levels of nesting. The optimal sample sizes are a function of the variances at each level and the cost of each unit. Overall, larger effect sizes, smaller intraclass correlations at the second and third level, and lower cost of level-3 and level-2 units result in higher estimates of power.",I

The paper reviews the existing evidence and concludes that on average the economic effects of immigration were beneficial, although their distributional consequences were adverse. Greek immigration policy was haphazard and more efforts are needed in order to integrate the immigrants in the economic and social fabric of the country.",F
"Kramarz, Francis|Machin, Stephen|Ouazad, Amine","What Makes a Test Score? The Respective Contributions of Pupils, Schools, and Peers in Achievement in English Primary Education","This study develops an analytical framework for evaluating the respective contributions of pupils, peers, and school quality in affecting educational achievement. We implement this framework using rich data from England that matches pupils to their primary schools. The dataset records all English pupils and their test scores in Key Stage 1 (age 7) and Key Stage 2 (age 11) national examinations. The quality of the data source, coupled with our econometric techniques, allows us to assess the respective importance of different educational inputs. We can distinguish school effects, that affect all pupils irrespective of their year and grade of study, from school-grade-year effects. Identification of pupil effects separately from these school-grade-year effects is achieved because students are mobile across schools. Peer effects are identified assuming variations in school-grade-year group composition in adjacent years are exogenous. We estimate three different specifications, the most general allowing Key Stage 2 results to be affected by the Key Stage 1 school(-grade-year) at which the pupil studied. We discuss the validity of our various exogeneity assumptions. Estimation results show statistically significant pupil ability, school and peer effects. Our analysis suggests the following ranking: pupils' ability and background are more important than school time-invariant inputs. Peer effects are significant, but small.",I
"Bressoux, Pascal|Kramarz, Francis|Prost, Corinne","Teachers' Training, Class Size and Students' Outcomes: Learning from Administrative Forecasting Mistakes","This paper studies the impact of different teacher and class characteristics on third graders' outcomes. It uses a feature of the French system in which some novice teachers start their jobs before receiving any training. Three categories of teachers are included in the sample: experienced teachers, trained novice teachers and untrained novice teachers. To identify the effects, we use administrative mistakes in forecasting the number of teachers. We find that trained and untrained novice teachers are assigned to similar classes, whereas experienced teachers have better students located in better environments. Hence, in order to match similar students and classes, we focus on pupils with novice teachers and discard those with experienced teachers. In addition, we show that the same sample can be used to estimate the causal effect of class size on students' outcomes. Our findings are: (1) teachers' training substantially improves students' test scores in mathematics; (2) this training effect does not rely on different teaching practices, but mainly on subject matter competence; untrained teachers who majored in sciences at university improve their students' achievement as much as trained teachers do; (3) the class size effect is substantial and significant; class size does not seem to be correlated with instructional practices; (4) teachers' training does not improve the scores of initially low-achieving students and classes; on the contrary, a smaller class is more beneficial to low-achieving students within classes and to all students in low-achieving classes.",I

Yet there is little scientific evidence that such data are meaningful. This study examines a 2005-2008 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System random sample of 1.3 million United States citizens. Life-satisfaction in each U.S. state is measured. Across America, people's answers trace out the same pattern of quality of life as previously estimated, using solely non-subjective data, in a literature from economics (so-called 'compensating differentials' neoclassical theory due originally to Adam Smith). There is a state-by-state match (r = 0.6, p < 0.001) between subjective and objective well-being. This result has some potential to help to unify disciplines.",I
"Machin, Stephen|Salvanes, Kjell G.","Valuing School Quality via a School Choice Reform","Among policymakers, educators and economists there remains a strong, sometimes heated, debate on the extent to which good schools matter. This is seen, for instance, in the strong trend towards establishing accountability systems in education in many countries across the world. In this paper, in line with some recent studies, we value school quality using house prices. We, however, adopt a rather different approach to other work, using a policy experiment regarding pupils' choice to attend high schools to identify the relationship between house prices and school performance. We exploit a change in school choice policy that took place in Oslo county in 1997, where the school authorities opened up the possibility for every pupil to apply to any of the high schools in the county without having to live in the school's catchment area (the rule that applied before 1997). Our estimates show evidence that parents substantially value better performing schools since the sensitivity of housing valuations to school performance falls significantly by over 50% following the school choice reform.",I

We make use of data from the NBA season 2007/2008 and measure risk taking by the fraction of three-point shots. Current heterogeneity of teams is taken into account by intermediate results. It turns out that indeed teams who are behind increase the risk in terms of more three-point attempts. We additionally analyze the consequences of this change in behavior. Enhanced risk taking is inefficient for the vast majority of cases and only beneficial in terms of a higher winning probability if a team is behind with a rather large amount of points. We discuss possible explanations for these decision errors.",M

The development of the budget allocation formula is demonstrated utilizing Israeli data.

Class size and time-in-term are both important school choice variables and we examine how provincial achievement differences would change if the Alberta distribution of class size and time-in-term prevailed in the other provinces. Results differ by province, and for provinces where mean achievement gaps would be lower, not all students would benefit.",I

The roles of establishment size, multinational ownership and the human resources management department in the incidence of pay for performance plans and their variability of use across occupations within the same firm are also studied. These factors are found to correlate to a greater use of pay for performance and, in most cases, this effect is homogenous across occupations.",M
"Lei, Xiaoyan|Yin, Nina|Zhao, Yaohui","SES Health Gradients during the Epidemiological Transition: The Case of China","The epidemiological transition, which has already passed the developed world, is still progressing in many developing countries. A particular problem associated with this transition is the under-diagnosis and lack of treatment of chronic diseases, and these may exhibit SES gradients and exacerbate social inequality. Using hypertension as an example and data from China (CHNS), we find that the prevalence of hypertension in China is already close to levels in developed countries, under-diagnosis is pervasive, treatment is rare, and failure to control is widespread. Consistent with the literature, we find no income and education gradients in the prevalence of hypertension. However, there are strong education gradients in diagnosis and treatment in urban areas. The income gradients in all aspects of hypertension are relatively weak and sometimes nonexistent. Interestingly, we find that access to health care does not contribute to the diagnosis of hypertension, nor does it aid much in the treatment and control of hypertension. Our results suggest that the epidemiological transition has indeed occurred, but both the Chinese public and its health care system are ill-prepared. There is an urgent need to educate the public on chronic illnesses, and to raise the quality of health care so that patients receive proper diagnoses and guidance on how to treat and control those chronic illnesses.",I
"Black, Sandra E.|Devereux, Paul|Salvanes, Kjell G.","Under Pressure? The Effect of Peers on Outcomes of Young Adults","A variety of public campaigns, including the Just Say No campaign of the 1980s and 1990s that encouraged teenagers to Just Say No to Drugs, are based on the premise that teenagers are very susceptible to peer influences. Despite this, very little is known about the effect of school peers on the long-run outcomes of teenagers. This is primarily due to two factors: the absence of information on peers merged with long-run outcomes of individuals and, equally important, the difficulty of separately identifying the role of peers. This paper uses data on the population of Norway and idiosyncratic variation in cohort composition within schools to examine the role of peer composition in 9th grade on longer-run outcomes such as IQ scores at age 18, teenage childbearing, post-compulsory schooling educational track, adult labor market status, and earnings. We find that outcomes are influenced by the proportion of females in the grade, and these effects differ for men and women. Other peer variables (average age, average mother's education) have little impact on the outcomes of teenagers.",I

It is unique in being able to follow two cohorts of students in England  those who took GCSEs in 2001-02 and 2002-03  from age 11 to age 20. The findings suggest that while there remain large raw gaps in HE participation (and participation at high-status universities) by socio-economic status, these differences are substantially reduced once controls for prior attainment are included. Moreover, these findings hold for both state and private school students. This suggests that poor attainment in secondary schools is more important in explaining lower HE participation rates amongst students from disadvantaged backgrounds than barriers arising at the point of entry into HE. These findings highlight the need for earlier policy intervention to raise HE participation rates amongst disadvantaged youth.",I
"Banks, James|Muriel, Alastair|Smith, James P.","Disease Prevalence, Disease Incidence, and Mortality in the United States and in England","We find disease incidence and prevalence are both higher among Americans in age groups 55-64 and 70-80 indicating that Americans suffer from higher past cumulative disease risk and experience higher immediate risk of new disease onset compared to the English. In contrast, age specific mortality rates are similar in the two countries with an even higher risk among the English after age 65. Our second aim explains large financial gradients in mortality in the two countries. Among 55-64 year olds, we estimate similar health gradients in income and wealth in both countries, but for 70-80 year old, we find no income gradient in UK. Standard behavioral risk factors (work, marriage, obesity, exercise, and smoking) almost fully explain income gradients among 55-64 years old in both countries and a significant part among Americans 70-80 years old. The most likely explanation of no English income gradient relates to their income benefit system. Below the median, retirement benefits are largely flat and independent of past income and hence past health during the working years. Finally, we report evidence using a long panel of American respondents that their subsequent mortality is not related to large changes in wealth experienced during the prior ten year period.",I
"Strauss, John|Lei, Xiaoyan|Park, Albert|Shen, Yan|Smith, James P.|Yang, Zhe|Zhao, Yaohui","Health Outcomes and Socio-Economic Status among the Elderly in China: Evidence from the CHARLS Pilot","We are concerned in this paper with measuring health outcomes among the elderly in Zhejiang and Gansu provinces, China, and examining the relationships between different dimensions of health status and measures of socio-economic status (SES). We use the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) pilot data to document health conditions among the elderly in Gansu and Zhejiang provinces, where the survey was fielded. We use a very rich set of health indicators that include both self-reported measures and biomarkers. We also examine correlations between these health outcomes and two important indicators of socioeconomic status (SES): education and log of per capita expenditure (log pce), our preferred measure of household resources. While there exists a very large literature that examines the relationships between SES and health measures, little has been done on Chinese data to see whether correlations reported in many other countries are replicated in China, particularly so for the aged. In general education tends to be positively correlated with better health outcomes, as it is in other countries. However, unmeasured community influences turn out to be highly important, much more so than one usually finds in other countries. While it is not yet clear which aspects of communities matter and why they matter, we set up an agenda for future research on this topic. We also find a large degree of under-diagnosis of hypertension, a major health problems that afflicts the aged. This implies that the current health system is not well prepared to address the rapid aging of the Chinese population, at least not in Gansu and Zhejiang.",I
"Banks, James|Muriel, Alastair|Smith, James P.","Attrition and Health in Ageing Studies: Evidence from ELSA and HRS","In this paper we present results of an investigation into observable characteristics associated with attrition in ELSA and the HRS, with a particular focus on whether attrition is systematically related to health outcomes and socioeconomic status (SES). Investigating the links between health and SES is one of the primary goals of the ELSA and HRS, so attrition correlated with these outcomes is a critical concern. We explored some possible reasons for these differences. Survey maturity, mobility, respondent burden, interviewer quality, and differing sampling methods all fail to account for the gap. Differential respondent incentives may play some role, but the impact of respondent incentive is difficult to test. Apparently, cultural differences between the US and Europe population in agreeing to participate and remain in scientific surveys are a more likely explanation.",I
"Wagner, Joachim","The Post-Entry Performance of Cohorts of Export Starters in German Manufacturing Industries","This paper investigates four cohorts of firms from German manufacturing industries that started to export in the years between 1998 and 2002 and follows them over the five years after the start. Export starters are a rare species and they are small on average compared to incumbent exporters. Between 30 percent and 40 percent of the starters became continuous exporters; some starters stepped out and back into exporting, many of them more than once. The share of total exports contributed by export starters of a cohort is tiny in the start year, and it remains so over the years to follow, although those starters that were exporters in year t+5 had a share of exports in total sales that was more than twice as high as the average share of exports in total sales among the export starters of the same cohort in year t. Contrary to the market selection hypothesis there is no evidence that productivity in the start year is systematically related to survival in the export market. There is no evidence for a negative impact of a smaller firm size in the start year on the chance to survive on the export market. Starting with a higher share of exports in total sales, however, tends to increase the probability to stay on the export market.",F
"Wagner, Joachim","Exports and Firm Characteristics in German Manufacturing Industries","Reliable information on the characteristics of exporting and non-exporting firms is important to guide theorists and policy makers in an evidence based way. This holds true especially for Germany, a leading actor on the world markets for goods and services. This paper makes three contributions towards this aim: (1) It provides a synopsis and a critical assessment of 51 empirical studies on exports and firm characteristics that use data for German establishments or enterprises, arguing that this literature is not suited to extract the stylized facts needed. (2) It uses recently released rich high quality data for a large representative panel of enterprises from German manufacturing industries to investigate the links between firm characteristics and export activities, demonstrating the decisive role of human capital intensity for exporting. (3) It links these findings to the recent literature from the new new trade theory on international activities of heterogeneous firms that emphasises the role of productivity for exporting. It shows that productivity is important for exporting as is hypothesized in the formal theoretical models, but that contrary to the assumption made in these models productivity is not (only) the result from a random draw from the productivity distribution  it is strongly positively related to human capital intensity.",F
"Bandick, Roger|Görg, Holger|Karpaty, Patrik","Foreign Acquisitions, Domestic Multinationals, and R&D","The aim of this paper is to evaluate the causal effect of foreign acquisition on R&D intensity in targeted domestic firms. We are able to distinguish domestic multinationals and non-multinationals, which allows us to investigate the fear that the change in ownership of domestic to foreign multinationals leads to a reduction in R&D activity in the country, as headquarter activities are relocated to the new owner's home country. We use unique and rich firm level data for the Swedish manufacturing sector and different micro-econometric estimation strategies in order to control for the potential endogeneity of the acquisition dummy. Overall, our results give no support to the fears that foreign acquisition of domestic firms lead to a brain drain of R&D activity in Swedish MNEs. Rather, this paper finds robust evidence that foreign acquisitions lead to increasing R&D intensity in acquired domestic MNEs and non-MNEs.",F
"Grund, Christian|Martin, Johannes","Determinants of Further Training: Evidence for Germany","Based on a German representative sample of employees we explore the relevance and development of further training in private sector firms. We focus on formal training and explore possible individual and job-based determinants of its incidence. We also show changes over time during a 20 year observation period from 1989 to 2008. Most hypotheses are supported by the empirical evidence. Job status and firm size are the most relevant characteristics for training participation. Furthermore, our analyses reveal a general trend of rising training rates from 1989 to 2008 indicating an increased importance in the German labor market.",M
"Lozano, Fernando A.|Steinberger, Michael D.","Empirical Methods in the Economics of International Immigration","In this chapter we provide a brief overview of the main empirical tools used by economists to study international migration. We begin by exploring the three broad research areas that economists examine when researching immigration. We then explore the strengths and shortcomings of the standard methods, and highlight new methods that will likely become more common in future work in the field. We divide the most common tools used in the empirical literature into four broad categories: (1) Ordinary Least Squares and Inference, (2) Difference-in-Difference Estimation, (3) Instrumental Variables Techniques, and (4) Recent Developments and Distributional Estimators. We use recent empirical work to highlight and explain each method, and provide sources for researchers interested in further information on each topic.",F
"Brück, Tilman|Llussá, Fernanda|Tavares, José","Perceptions, Expectations, and Entrepreneurship: The Role of Extreme Events","We provide, for the first time, comparative evidence of the impact of various types of extreme events  natural disasters, terrorism, and violent conflicts  on the perceptions of entrepreneurs concerning some key entrepreneurial issues  such as fear of failure in starting a business venture, whether individuals expect that good opportunities are likely to emerge in the next six months, and the expected level of competition stemming from creating new ventures. The occurrence of extreme events is likely to be exogenous to the perceptions affecting it so that we can identify a causal link from events to entrepreneurs and their perceptions. Using individual-level data from 43 countries from the period 2002 to 2005, we find that neither indicator of the intensity of extreme events has a significant impact on entrepreneurial activity, when country characteristics are not controlled for. Once invariant country characteristics are taken into account, we find that Terrorist Attacks have a positive and significant impact on business creation, Natural Disasters have a positive and negative impact on entrepreneurial activity, and Violent Conflict has no significant effect. These results are consistent with differential impacts of extreme events on perception variables such as Fear of Failure, Expected Business Opportunities, and Expected Level of Competition. Our results suggest that extreme events, while costly at the aggregate level, may induce a positive response in terms of entrepreneurial activity in specific circumstances. There is hence scope for entrepreneurs, and policies supporting them, to create growth from the ruins of extreme events.",F
"Boppart, Timo|Falkinger, Josef|Grossmann, Volker","Protestantism and Education: Reading (the Bible) and Other Skills","During industrialization, Protestants were more literate than Catholics. This paper investigates whether this fact may be led back to the intrinsic motivation of Protestants to read the bible and whether other education motives were involved as well. We employ a historical data set from Switzerland which allows us to differentiate between different cognitive skills: reading, numeracy, essay writing and Swiss history. We develop an estimation strategy to examine whether the impact of religious denomination was particularly large with respect to reading capabilities. We find support for this hypothesis. However, Protestants education motives went beyond reading the bible.",I
"Böckerman, Petri|Hämäläinen, Ulla|Uusitalo, Roope","Labour Market Effects of the Polytechnic Education Reform: The Finnish Experience","This paper evaluates the labour market effects of the introduction of the polytechnic education system in Finland. The polytechnic reform gradually transformed former vocational colleges into polytechnics. Since the timing of the reform differed across schools, we can compare the performance of polytechnic graduates to the performance of vocational college graduates controlling for both the year and the school effects. The results are somewhat sensitive to how the selectivity issues are treated but generally suggest that both the earnings and the employment levels of post-reform graduates are higher in the field of business and administration. The effects are much smaller and usually insignificant in other fields.",I
"Beine, Michel|Docquier, Frédéric|Rapoport, Hillel","On the Robustness of Brain Gain Estimates","Recent theoretical studies suggest that migration prospects can raise the expected return to human capital and thus foster education investment at home or, in other words, induce a brain gain. In a recent paper (Beine, Docquier and Rapoport, Economic Journal, 2008) we used the Docquier and Marfouk (2006) data set on emigration rates by education level to examine the impact of brain drain migration on gross (pre-migration) human capital formation in developing countries. We found a positive effect of skilled migration prospects on human capital growth in a cross-section of 127 developing countries, with an elasticity of about 5 percent. In this paper we assess the robustness of our results to the use of alternative brain drain measures, definitions of human capital, and functional forms. We find that the results hold using the Beine et al. (2007) alternative brain drain measures controlling for whether migrants acquired their skills in the home or in the host country. We also regress other indicators of human capital investment on skilled migration rates and find a positive effect on youth literacy while the effect on school enrolment depends on the exact specification chosen.",F
"Webber, Douglas A.|Ehrenberg, Ronald G.","Do Expenditures Other Than Instructional Expenditures Affect Graduation and Persistence Rates in American Higher Education?","Median instructional spending per full-time equivalent (FTE) student at American colleges and universities has grown at a slower rate the median spending per FTE in a number of other expenditure categories during the last two decades. We use institutional level panel data and a variety of econometric approaches, including unconditional quantile regression models, to analyze whether noninstructional expenditure categories influence first year persistence and graduation rates of American undergraduate students. Our most important finding is that student service expenditures influence graduation and persistence rates and their marginal effects are larger for students at institutions with lower entrance test scores and more lower income students. Put another way, their effects are largest at institutions that have lower current persistence and graduation rates. Simulations suggest that reallocating some funding from instruction to student services may enhance persistence and graduation rates at those institutions whose rates are currently below the medians in the sample.",I

The model provides a formal framework for interpreting empirical results on the effect of compulsory-schooling legislation (CSL) on enrollment. This sheds light on the use of CSL as an instrumental variable to identify the benefits of schooling, suggesting how the estimates it produces may be biased.",I
"Howard, Larry L.|Prakash, Nishith","Do Means-Tested School Lunch Subsidies Change Children's Weekly Consumption Patterns?","This article examines whether the means-tested component of the National School Lunch Program changes beneficiaries' dietary patterns by taking advantage of variation across public school districts in the financing of and demand for lunch and nutrition programs. Using data on fifth grade public elementary school children in the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten (2003-2004), we find significant increases in weekly rates of consumption amongst fully and partially subsidized children. Our estimates also suggest that the increase was for items known to be a rich source of vitamins and minerals that are essential for children's health and development. The effects are larger for fully subsidized children relative to partially subsidized children, which suggests the nominal price of school lunch is a binding constraint for certain children on the margin of eligibility for the subsidies. To the extent that children from low-income households experience undernourishment with greater frequency, policy discussion focusing exclusively on the link between obesity and program participation is overlooking positive effects on those who are directly subsidized.",I
"Brücker, Herbert|Fachin, Stefano|Venturini, Alessandra","Do Foreigners Replace Native Immigrants? Evidence from a Panel Cointegration Analysis","This paper examines the impact of the immigration of foreigners on domestic labour mobility. Since David Card's seminal study on the regional labour market impact of the Mariel Boatlift it is controversial whether domestic labour mobility equilibrates economic conditions across cities and regions. However, there is little or no evidence that natives leave destinations where migrants tend to cluster. In this paper we reconcile the existing evidence by taking another route. We analyze whether the immigration of foreigners replaces domestic mobility from poor to rich regions. We focus on Italy, which is characterized by market differences in earnings between the North and the South. Based on a panel cointegration approach we exploit the variance of international and internal migration over time for identifying potential displacement effects. The main finding is that, conditional on unemployment and wage differentials, the share of foreign workers in the labour force of the destination regions discourages internal labour mobility significantly. As a consequence, spatial correlation studies which use the variance of the foreigner share across region for identifying the wage and employment effects of immigration, tend to understate the actual immigration impact.",F

I make use of a unique data set, the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, a phone survey undertaken in the United States for the years 2005-2009. I find evidence that not having the ability to see a doctor because of an inability to pay is a major and substantial source of unhappiness in the United States, even for people with high income.",I
"Halliday, Timothy|He, Hui|Zhang, Hao","Health Investment over the Life-Cycle","We study the evolution of health investment over the life-cycle by calibrating a model of endogenous health accumulation. The model is able to produce the decline in labor supply with age as well as the hump-shaped consumption profile. In both cases, health and health investment play a crucial role as the former encroaches upon healthy time and the latter crowds out non-medical expenditures as people age. Finally, we quantify the value of health as both an investment and a consumption good. We show that the investment motive is about three times higher than the consumption motive during the early 20s, but decreases over the life-cycle until it disappears at retirement. In contrast, the consumption motive increases with age and surpasses the investment motive during the mid 40s.",I
"Konstantopoulos, Spyros","How Consistent Are Class Size Effects?","Evidence from Project STAR has suggested that on average small classes increase student achievement. However, thus far researchers have focused on computing mean differences in student achievement between smaller and larger classes. In this study I focus on the distribution of the small class effects at the school level and compute the inconsistency of the treatment effects across schools. I use data from Project STAR and estimated small class effects for each school on mathematics and reading scores from kindergarten through third grade. The results revealed that school-specific small class effects are both positive and negative and that although students benefit considerably from being in small classes in some schools, in other schools being in small classes is a disadvantage. Small class effects were inconsistent and varied significantly across schools. Full time teacher aide effects were also inconsistent across schools and in some schools students benefit considerably from being in regular classes with a full time aide, while in other schools being in these classes is a disadvantage.",I
"Paulus, Alari|Sutherland, Holly|Tsakloglou, Panos","The Distributional Impact of In Kind Public Benefits in European Countries","International comparisons of inequality based on measures of disposable income may not be valid if the size and incidence of publicly-provided in kind benefits differ across the countries considered. The benefits that are financed by taxation in one country may need to be purchased out of disposable income in another. We estimate the size and incidence of in kind or non cash benefits from public housing subsidies, education and health care for five European countries using comparable methods and data. Inequality in the augmented income measure is dramatically lower than in disposable income, with the effects of the three components varying in importance across countries. Adapting equivalence scales to take proper account of differences in needs for health care and education across population members reduces the scale of the effect, but does not eliminate it.",I
"Wagner, Joachim","Offshoring and Firm Performance: Self-Selection, Effects on Performance, or Both?","This paper uses unique new data for German manufacturing enterprises from matched regular surveys and a special purpose survey to investigate the causal effect of relocation of activities to a foreign country on various dimensions of firm performance. Enterprises that relocated activities abroad in the period 2001-03 for the first time are compared to firms that did not relocate activities abroad before 2006. The comparison is performed for both 2004 (to document differences between the two groups of firms after some of them started to relocate abroad) and for 2000 (when none of them did relocate abroad). It turns out that, compared to non-offshoring firms, firms that relocated activities were larger and more productive, and had a higher share of exports in total sales. All these differences existed in 2000, the year before some firms started to relocate, and this points to self-selection of better firms into offshoring. This finding is in line with results from recent theoretical models and with results from other countries. To investigate the causal effects of relocation across borders on firm performance, six different variants of a matching approach of firms that did and did not start to relocate abroad in 2001-03 were performed based on a propensity score estimated using firm characteristics in 2000 and the change in the performance variable between 1997 and 2000. The performance of both groups was compared for 2004-06 when some firms were relocating firms and the others were not. Broadly in line with hypotheses derived from the literature there is no evidence that offshoring has a negative causal impact on employment in offshoring firms. The effect is positive and large for productivity, and weak evidence for a positive effect on the wage per employee, the proxy variable for human capital intensity used, is found. Contrary to what is often argued, therefore, we find no evidence for a negative causal effect of offshoring on employment in Germany or on other core dimensions of firm performance.",F
"Friesen, Jane|Javdani, Mohsen|Woodcock, Simon D.","Does Public Information about School Quality Lead to Flight from Low-Achieving Schools?","We estimate the effect of publicly disseminated information about school-level achievement on students' mobility between elementary schools. We find that students are more likely to leave their school when poor school-level performance is revealed. In general, parents respond to information soon after it becomes available. Once the information is absorbed, they do not respond to subsequent releases, even when it is reframed and given widespread media attention. Parents in low-income neighborhoods and those who speak a non-English language at home respond most strongly. However, non-English speaking parents only respond when information is widely disseminated and discussed in the media.",I
"Cohen-Zada, Danny|Gradstein, Mark|Reuven, Ehud","Class Size and the Regression Discontinuity Design: The Case of Public Schools","Using a rich individual-level dataset on secondary public schools in Israel, we find strong evidence for discontinuities in the relationship between enrollment and household characteristics at cutoff points induced by a maximum class size rule. Our findings extend existing work that documents such discontinuities only among private schools (Urquiola and Verhoogen, 2009). These discontinuities violate the assumptions underlying the regression discontinuity design, which are crucial for identification. Consequently, IV estimates of class size effects are likely to be seriously biased. Potential manipulation of the treatment assignment rule by public schools warrants caution in applying a regression discontinuity design to estimate class size effects and indicates that institutional context is crucial for its scope of applicability.",I

Their sequencing in relation to other policy goals such as financial sector reforms and exchange rate flexibility will affect their benefit-risk tradeoffs. We describe the measures taken and progress attained in each of these areas, and discuss the implications of these changes for the balance and sustainability of China's own economic development as well as the associated implications for the global monetary system. While China is actively promoting the internationalization of its currency, it is a long way from attaining full convertibility or meeting other prerequisites for achieving reserve currency status. Ultimately, China will proceed with capital account convertibility in its own controlled and gradual manner, with the goal being an open capital account but with significant administrative and other soft controls. The renminbi will play an increasingly important role in the international monetary system but is unlikely to displace the U.S. dollar anytime soon.",F
"Frederiksen, Anders|Lange, Fabian|Kriechel, Ben","Subjective Performance Evaluations and Employee Careers","Firms commonly use supervisor ratings to evaluate employees when objective performance measures are unavailable. Supervisor ratings are subjective and data containing supervisor ratings typically stem from individual firm level data sets. For both these reasons, doubts persist on how useful such data are for evaluating theories in personnel economics and whether findings from such data generalize to the labor force at large. In this paper, we examine personnel data from six large companies and establish how subjective ratings, interpreted as ordinal rankings of employees within narrowly defined peer-groups, correlate with objective career outcomes. We find many similarities across firms in how subjective ratings correlate with earnings, base pay, bonuses, promotions, demotions, separations, quits and dismissals and cautiously propose these as empirical regularities.",M

The objective is to raise domestic employment. Given that many of the important international markets where the US has a comparative advantage feature non-atomistic firms, we evaluate the implications of such policies in an oligopolistic context. We find that while an outsourcing tax favors domestic workers by causing firms to switch to a greater use of domestic sources (the substitution effect), the loss in international competitiveness has a negative volume effect (the output effect), which pulls in the other direction. First, we identify the conditions that determine the relative strengths of these effects, which inform us about the conditions under which such a tax achieves its stated objective. Next, we consider the international policy interdependence that arises when a competing nation also engages in such a policy. An interesting finding is that even if a unilateral tax by the US raises its employment, this may turn around in a Nash policy equilibrium, where the competing nation abandons free trade and also engages in unilateral outsourcing policies. Finally, we extend the basic model to look at the effects of credit shortage and product differentiation. Interesting findings are that both a credit crisis (as in recent years) and increased product differentiation tend to worsen the employment effects of the outsourcing tax. The qualitative nature of our findings is similar between Cournot and Bertrand competition, suggesting that our results are robust to the mode of strategic behavior.",F

Using rich administrative data on benefit receipt histories and a selection on observed variables identification strategy, we find that the program modestly reduces benefit receipt among participants. Methodologically, we highlight the importance of flexibly conditioning on benefit histories, as well as taking account of complex sample designs when applying matching methods. We find that survey measures of attitudes add information beyond that contained in the benefit histories and that incorporating the insights of the recent literature on dynamic treatment effects matters even when not formally applying the related methods. Finally, we explain why our results differ substantially from those of the official evaluation of NDLP, which found very large impacts on benefit exits.",I

The original motivation to study this topic were reports that the strong increase in the number of college graduates in the early 1970s in the US led to a decrease in the returns to college education. We argue that Duncan and Hoffmans augmented wage equation  the workhorse model in the overeducation literature  in which wages are regressed on years of overschooling, years of required schooling and years of underschooling is at best loosely related to this original motivation. We discuss measurement and estimation issues and give an overview of the main empirical findings in this literature. Finally we given an appraisal of the economic lessons learned.",I
"Braga, Michela|Paccagnella, Marco|Pellizzari, Michele","Evaluating Students' Evaluations of Professors","This paper contrasts measures of teacher effectiveness with the students' evaluations for the same teachers using administrative data from Bocconi University (Italy). The effectiveness measures are estimated by comparing the subsequent performance in follow-on coursework of students who are randomly assigned to teachers in each of their compulsory courses. We find that, even in a setting where the syllabuses are fixed and all teachers in the same course present exactly the same material, teachers still matter substantially. The average difference in subsequent performance between students who were assigned to the best and worst teacher (on the effectiveness scale) is approximately 43% of a standard deviation in the distribution of exam grades, corresponding to about 5.6% of the average grade. Additionally, we find that our measure of teacher effectiveness is negatively correlated with the students' evaluations: in other words, teachers who are associated with better subsequent performance receive worst evaluations from their students. We rationalize these results with a simple model where teachers can either engage in real teaching or in teaching-to-the-test, the former requiring higher students effort than the latter. Teaching-to-the-test guarantees high grades in the current course but does not improve future outcomes. Hence, if students are myopic and evaluate better teachers from which they derive higher utility in a static framework, the model is capable of predicting our empirical finding that good teachers receive bad evaluations, especially when teaching-to-the-test is very effective (for example, with multiple choice tests).

Two new measures used here  the ratio of persons in the lowest income decile relative to the number in the highest, and the ratio of the number in the lowest social class relative to the number in the highest, in a given country  as developed from the World Values Survey data, are shown here to have a negative and significant effect on both happiness and life satisfaction. This effect holds overall across countries, and for individuals within most income and class categories.",I
"Carman, Katherine Grace|Kooreman, Peter","Flu Shots, Mammograms, and the Perception of Probabilities","We study individuals' decisions to decline or accept preventive health care interventions such as flu shots and mammograms. In particular, we analyze the role of perceptions of the effectiveness of the intervention, by eliciting individuals' subjective probabilities of sickness and survival, with and without the interventions. Respondents appear to be aware of some of the qualitative relationships between risk factors and probabilities. However, on average they have very poor perceptions of the absolute probability levels as reported in the epidemiological literature. Perceptions are less accurate if a respondent is female and has no college degree. Perceived probabilities significantly affect the subsequent take-up rate of flu shots and mammograms.",I
"Wagner, Joachim","Exports, Imports and Profitability: First Evidence for Manufacturing Enterprises","This paper documents for the first time the relationship between profitability and three types of international trade activities  exports, imports and two-way trade. It uses unique new representative data for manufacturing enterprises from Germany, one of the leading actors on the world market for goods, that merge information from surveys performed by the Statistical Offices and administrative data collected by the Tax Authorities. Descriptive statistics and regression analysis (with and without controlling for unobserved firm heterogeneity and the role of outliers) point to the absence of any statistically significant and economically large effects of trade activities on profits. This demonstrates that any productivity advantages of trading firms are eaten up by extra costs related to selling and buying on foreign markets.",F
"Goeree, Michelle S.|Ham, John C.|Iorio, Daniela","Race, Social Class, and Bulimia Nervosa","In this paper we explore a serious eating disorder, bulimia nervosa (BN), which afflicts a surprising number of girls in the US. We challenge the long-held belief that BN primarily affects high income White teenagers, using a unique data set on adolescent females evaluated regarding their tendencies towards bulimic behaviors independent of any diagnoses or treatment they have received. Our results reveal that African Americans are more likely to exhibit bulimic behavior than Whites; as are girls from low income families compared to middle and high income families. We use another data set to show that who is diagnosed with an eating disorder is in accord with popular beliefs, suggesting that African American and low-income girls are being under-diagnosed for BN. Our findings have important implications for public policy since they provide direction to policy makers regarding which adolescent females are most at risk for BN. Our results are robust to different model specifications and identifying assumptions.",I
"Dearden, Lorraine|Micklewright, John|Vignoles, Anna","The Effectiveness of English Secondary Schools for Pupils of Different Ability Levels","'League table' information on school effectiveness in England generally relies on either a comparison of the average outcomes of pupils by school, e.g. mean exam scores, or on estimates of the average value added by each school. These approaches assume that the information parents and policy-makers need most to judge school effectiveness is the average achievement level or gain in a particular school. Yet schools can be differentially effective for children with differing levels of prior attainment. We present evidence on the extent of differential effectiveness in English secondary schools, and find that even the most conservative estimate suggests that around one quarter of schools in England are differentially effective for students of differing prior ability levels. This affects an even larger proportion of children as larger schools are more likely to be differentially effective.",I

This paper attempts to summarize what we learn from this literature to guide both future empirical and theoretical work in this area, and public debates and policy makers, in an evidence-based way. The focus is on the empirical part of the literature that consists of recently published papers using data for firms from manufacturing or services industries to study the links between international trade (exports and imports) and dimensions of firm performance (productivity, wages, profitability and survival). It discusses recent add-ons to the box of tools for empirical investigation in this field and suggests topics for future research.",F
"Leuven, Edwin|Rønning, Marte","Classroom Grade Composition and Pupil Achievement","This paper exploits discontinuous grade mixing rules in Norwegian junior high schools to estimate how classroom grade composition affects pupil achievement. Pupils in mixed grade classrooms are found to outperform pupils in single grade classrooms on high stake central exit tests and teacher set and graded tests. This effect is driven by pupils benefiting from sharing the classroom with more mature peers from higher grades. The presence of lower grade peers is detrimental for achievement. Pupils can therefore benefit from de-tracking by grade, but the effects depend crucially on how the classroom is balanced in terms of lower and higher grades. These results reconcile the contradictory findings in the literature.",I

"Konstantopoulos, Spyros|Sun, Min","Is the Persistence of Teacher Effects in Early Grades Larger for Lower-Performing Students?","We examined the persistence of teacher effects from grade to grade on lower-performing students using high-quality experimental data from Project STAR, where students and teachers were assigned randomly to classrooms of different sizes. The data included information about mathematics and reading scores and student demographics such as gender, race, and SES. Teacher effects were computed as residual classroom achievement within schools and within grades. Then, teacher effects were used as predictors of achievement in following grades and quantile regression was used to estimate their persistence. Results consistently indicated that all students benefited similarly from teachers. Overall, systematic differential teacher effects were not observed and it appears that lower-performing students benefit as much as other students from teachers. In fourth grade there was some evidence that lower-performing students benefit more from effective teachers. Results from longitudinal analyses suggested that having effective teachers in successive grades is beneficial to all students and to lower-performing students in particular in mathematics. However, having low-effective teachers in successive grades is detrimental to all students and to lower-performing students in particular in reading.",I
"Keslair, Francois|Maurin, Eric|McNally, Sandra","Every Child Matters? An Evaluation of Special Educational Needs Programmes in England","The need for education to help every child rather than focus on average attainment has become a more central part of the policy agenda in the US and the UK. Remedial programmes are often difficult to evaluate because participation is usually based on pupil characteristics that are largely unobservable to the analyst. In this paper we evaluate programmes for children with moderate levels of 'special educational needs' in England. We show that the decentralized design of the policy generates significant variations in access to remediation resources across children with similar prior levels of difficulty. However, this differential is not reflected in subsequent educational attainment  suggesting that the programme is ineffective for 'treated' children. In the second part of our analysis, we use demographic variation within schools to consider the effect of the programme on whole year groups. Our analysis is consistent with no overall effect on account of the combined direct and indirect (spillover) effects. Thus, the analysis suggests that a key way that English education purports to help children with learning difficulties is not working.",I

In particular, we test whether alternative reforms have increased the average educational attainment of the population and whether various deciles of the education distribution have been differentially affected. We constructed a dataset of relevant reforms occurred at the national level over the last century, and match individual information to the most likely set-up faced when individual educational choices were undertaken. Thus our identification strategy relies on temporal and geographical variations in the institutional arrangements, controlling for time/country fixed effects, as well as for confounding factors. We also explore who are the individual most likely affected by the reforms. We also group different reforms in order to ascertain the prevailing attitudes of policy makers, showing that reforms can belong to either inclusive or selective in their nature. Finally we correlate these attitudes to political coalitions prevailing in parliament, finding support to the idea that left wing parties support reforms that are inclusive in nature, while right wing parties prefer selective ones.",I

"Stampini, Marco|Tornarolli, Leopoldo","The Growth of Conditional Cash Transfers in Latin America and the Caribbean: Did They Go Too Far?","Conditional Cash Transfers (CCTs) are an endogenous innovation from Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) that aims to reduce current poverty while developing the human capital of the next generation, in the attempt to break the intergenerational transmission of poverty. Pioneered in Brazil and Mexico in the late 1990s, by 2011 CCTs had spread to 18 countries in the region and covered as many as 135 million beneficiaries. In this paper, we use administrative and household survey data to document (i) the evolution of CCTs and poverty in LAC, (ii) the relationship between expanded coverage and the quality of targeting and (iii) the change in beneficiary household characteristics. We show that in most countries the transfers represent over 20% of poor beneficiaries incomes, and the poverty headcount index would be on average 13% higher, had CCTs not been implemented. A decade of sustained and widespread economic growth has expanded the fiscal space for social assistance. The largest programs (in Brazil, Colombia and Mexico) have achieved coverage rates around 50-55% of the poor. At the same time, economic growth contributed to reducing the incidence of poverty. As a result, the number of CCT beneficiaries overtook the number of poor in the region in 2006 (using a standardized income poverty line of USD 2.5 per day (purchasing-power-parity adjusted)). Higher coverage was accompanied by increasing levels of leakage. For example, the share of non-poor beneficiaries increased from 46% to 65% in Ecuador over the period 2004-10 and from 40% to 61% in Mexico over the period 2002-10. Beneficiaries level of education and participation in formal labor markets have increased. Yet, the analysis of household data shows that CCT beneficiaries remain mostly poor or vulnerable, characterized by extremely low levels of schooling and unstable labor market outcomes. Hence, while further expansion of the programs may in many cases be unnecessary, the need for social assistance and human capital development remains high. The transition to the new generation of CCT programs will require focusing on the quality of the services that accompany the transfers, in order to maximize the impact on current and future poverty.",I
"Feri Hadi Priantio","The Effects of Trade Liberalization on Wage Inequality and Informality in Indonesia: An Empirical Study","This study investigates the equity perspective of Indonesiaâs trade liberalization. Using a two-stage estimation framework, the author exploited labor surveys and international trade data to examine how tariff reductions have influenced Indonesiaâs wage inequality and informality during its 1995-2006 episode of liberalization. The results provide evidence that tariff reductions have ambiguously affected inequality among Indonesian workers. First, they have reduced inequality by causing workers of highly liberalized industries â in 1995, their industries were known as low-paying industries â to experience higher wage increases relative to the economy-wide average, thus narrowing the wage gap. Second, they have increased inequality by causing workers of these highly liberalized industries â in 1995, these industries were also known to have a relatively high probability of informal employment â to experience higher increases on the probability of informal employment relative to the economy-wide average.This means that these unfortunate workers were more likely to receive even lower payments, to be employed in poorer working condition and to be covered with less social protection",F

We found tiiat the program has encouraged the active participation of poor communities in the development process in their area. In turn, this more active participation contributes to improved communities' social capital. The program also opened up access to financial sources for the poor, which lieiped them to participate in the production networks. However, the program also faced several  challenges. There has been a strong indication that the program was biased tozvards the interests of tlie rural elites. In addition, tlie program has marginalized the participation of local governments. It was also found that the quality of infrastructure financed by the program is relatively poor. The most worrying concern is that there is no clear exit strategy at the completion of the program. These ciiaiienges may potentially reduce the effectiveness of the rural PNPM in improving the living standards of the rural communities sustainably. Tills paper recommends a strong political commitment and some determined actions needed to address those challenges to improve the effectiveness of the program in enhancing living standard of the rural communities",R

"Maria Elo","Diaspora networks in international business and transnational entrepreneurship  A literature review","Many underlying developments of globalization should be investigated. Diaspora networks represent an invisible actor in international business (IB), and embody a channel and arena for transnational entrepreneurship (TE). Thus, understanding the development of contemporary diaspora networks and exploring their business potential is important. These networks impact multiple aspects of economic activity, such as investment, entrepreneurship, innovation, expansion, internationalization and creation of international businesses. Despite the multifaceted influence of diaspora networks, little empirical research on their effects has been conducted. This gap may originate in the lack of theoretical and conceptual rigor. In short, the term diaspora network remains to be fully discovered in international business. This paper contributes to the literature by increasing the understanding of diaspora networks by reviewing the current literature. The purpose is to enrich the conceptual and theoretical development of IB and TE by connecting them to the emerging field of diaspora entrepreneurship. The paper discusses diaspora networks, illustrates extant theories and research findings, and suggests issues for further research.",F

"Jolita Vveinhardt|Egle Stonkute|Jolanta Tkaczyk","Consumer Susceptibility to Social Influence and Tendency to Generate a Positive or Negative Message in Word of Mouth Communication","Susceptibility to social influence is expressed by inclination for fulfilling othersâ expectations, as well as by tendency to acquire information on products through observation of other peopleâs behaviour, and collecting opinions from them in active way. Word-of-mouth communication (WOM) is a specific form of social communication. Harrison-Walker as well as Mazzarol, Sweeney i Soutar treat the word-of-mouth as the process embracing discussions carried out upon the organization and its offer, during which a recommendation can be formulated. The message transmitted in the WOM communication can be of positive, negative or neutral character. The purpose of this article is to examine the relationship between consumer susceptibility to social influence and the tendency to generate positive or negative message. In order to measure susceptibility to social influence the Interpersonal Influence Scale will be applied (Bearden, Netenmeyer, Teel 1989). After analyzing the literature, the following research hypothesis was formulated: the stronger the participantâs susceptibility to social influence, the weaker tendency to generate a positive message and the stronger tendency to generate a negative one. To verify the hypotheses the research based on CAWI method were conducted in the group of 1000 people (aged 15-50), reflecting the structure of Polandâs population in terms of gender and place of residence, selected with random quota sampling. Only a minimal correlation was confirmed in case of the recommendation (positive opinion). There was no correlation between producing negative opinions and the susceptibility to social influence.",M

Questionnaires were administered to a range of different types of experts with a specialty in wine. Quantitative data from the Liquor Control Board of Ontario supplemented the core interviews. The results of this study indicate that differentiation through specialisation is the best strategy to develop the Niagara wine region. However, the structure of the wine industry encourages wineries to produce a vast array of grape varieties to cater to the needs of the domestic market. This has resulted in a loss of identity for the region. Though because Niagara Riesling is differentiable, world class, the most consistently awarded grape and unreproducible elsewhere, it is the prime candidate to become the representative grape for the region. By developing the Niagara style of Riesling and focusing on exporting small amounts of the variety, the region would benefit by developing an identity and increasing consumer confidence and sales.",M

Although there is a wide gap between rich and poor, identifying and targeting rich is a difficult proposition. The objective of this study was to find out how and why consumption basket of two sets was different from each other. Focused group discussion method followed by qualitative research tool of bubble drawing was used for this research. Total number of participants was 25 only and represented almost equally by both genders. Importantly, all of them were highly educated and were either independent professionals or senior executives. Interestingly none of them was from so-called royal rich family. However, age group varied widely from 35 to 68. Participants unanimously confirmed that liquid assets held by them were prime mover of their buying pattern. In their opinion, only ownership of fixed assets did not make an individual rich. Consumption basket consisted of small number of necessities and a large portion of luxury products. Interestingly, mobile handset and services was treated as necessity, I phone owned by them was treated as luxury. Similarly, a car as category was necessity for them, but a BMW owned was a luxury. Their responses to occasion, home, possession, investments, vacation, priorities, attitude to life, socialization, services needed, sports, cuisine and hobbies were decoded. On basis of the responses and discussion, two-dimension matrix was developed which included robust rich, fragile rich, robust poor and fragile poor. To conclude, marketers need to relook to the rich customers and further sub segment them into robust rich and fragile rich. This sub-segmentation shall help them in delivering value to the sets of customers in a more efficient and effective manner.",M

The research focuses on a combination of the individual dimension (individual motivators to be an innovator) and organizational dimension (creation of conditions to perform this role). The paper is an essay that approaches both a theoretical and empirical view, thus trying to define the major groups or organizations currently involved in education restructuring as well as their impact. Moreover, it addresses new groups that should take part of this process and the potential outcomes of their involvement. The main findings of the paper are a clear definition of the educational innovator, which can be used for any of the primary, secondary or post-secondary systems, as well as the current status of the higher education system in Romania and its barriers for innovation. It is true that the process of innovation in the educational environment has become increasingly important within the last two decades. However, the innovative university is still a new field of research, especially taking into account that traditional universities have had no real competition until the burst of technology. Therefore, this paper comes to supplement this field of innovation within the educational environment.",I
"Debra Riley|Peter Martins da Silva|Sabrina Behr","The Impact of Packaging Design on Health Product Perceptions","Packaging design has been studied in a variety of contexts but findings remain inconsistent, particularly on the impact of individual elements (e.g. Mitchell & Papvassiliou, 1999; Becker, Rompay, Schifferstein and Galetzka, 2011; Siloyoi & Speece, 2007). Although several studies have found visual cues (picture, typography, colour) to be the most impactful on consumer attention and attitude (e.g. Folkes & Matta, 2004; Silayoi & Speece, 2004), most studies have focused on other elements such as size and shape, (e.g. Ares & Deliza, 2010) and verbal cues (e.g. Klimchuk & Krasovec, 2013). Responding to recent calls for more research (Orth, Campana & Malkewitz 2010), this study investigates the impact of both visual elements and verbal elements on consumer perceptions, specifically looking at product âhealthinessâ. To date, there is relatively little research looking at health product perceptions in the marketing literature, despite recognition that health is âthe most significant trend and innovation driver in the global and foods drink marketâ (Meziane, 2007). This paper applies conjoint analysis to examine the relative importance of four product attributes representing visual and verbal cues: level of information provided on the label (low vs high); presence of an organic âkiteâ mark (yes/no); colour (green/orange) and the product image on the label (transparent window vs product photo). It is worth noting that despite being widely found on health food packaging, transparent windows have been considered in only one paper to date (Sioutis, 2011). Three product categories were tested (baby food, soup and coffee) across 288 UK participants. The results find verbal cues to be most important, with the amount of information provided being the key driver.",M
"Debra Riley|Mark Anderson","The Impact of Music Pleasantness and Fit on Advertising Attitudes for Low and High Involvement Consumers","Research in advertising suggests that music produces a substantial impact on a consumerâs attitude (e.g. Alpert and Alpert, 1989; Kellaris and Cox, 1989; North, MacKenzie, Law & Hargreaves, 2004; and Zander, 2006). However, there has been relatively little work on the mechanisms affecting low vs high involvement consumers. This study applies two dominant models on the impact of music in persuasion, classical conditioning and musical fit, to investigate the influence on low and high involvement consumers. Classical conditioning theory suggests that when a positive stimulus (i.e., the music) is associated with a neutral stimulus (the advertised product), the positive reaction to the music becomes associated with the product, leading to a favourable attitude (Gorn, 1982). Musical fit theory suggests that music activates information and evoked associations based on previous knowledge/familiarity, and when these fit the advertised product, the message becomes more persuasive (MacInnis and Park, 1991). Using an experimental design, 188 respondents saw advertisements paired with music that was pre-tested to be either pleasant/unpleasant (classical conditioning context) or congruent/incongruent with the product category (musical fit). Respondentâs involvement with the product category was also measured. The study found that âpleasantâ music significantly increased attitudes/purchase intention for low-involvement respondents (regardless of fit), while congruent music positively affected attitudes under high involvement conditions. Managerial implications and future research are discussed.",M

"Claudiu-CÄtÄlin Munteanu","Brand Extensions Differentiation: Implications for Strategy","The purpose of competitive strategy is to create and sustain competitive advantage. Traditionally, this is done by finding a favorable opportunity in a well-defined market and creating relevant differentiation. In this framework, brand extensions can represent a favorable opportunity for developing a winning competitive strategy. However, a competitive strategy that is not based on meaningful differentiation of brand extensions leads to a transient competitive advantage. The solution proposed by this article is centered on creating brand extensions that provide momentum for the brand, yield positive energy, enhance differentiation and further intensify core brand associations. Furthermore, brand extensions should provide new features that transcend product category boundaries, thus increasing product functionality, reliability and capabilities. From a competitive point of view, brand extensions should decrease rivalry among competitors by establishing dominance on an untapped criterion of purchase.",M

From marketing point of view, customer satisfaction indicates consistently doing something valueable for customers in the way meeting their expectations. This could influence consumerÂ´s attitudes during their subsequent decisions and enhance repeat purchase behaviour and positive word-of-mouth communication. In our research contribution of 21 individual attributes towards overall shopping satisfaction in seniorsÂ´ segment was analysed based on the empirical research in seniorsÂ´ population. All 21 attributes have been assigned to 6 broader marketing mix elements. To explain the complexity in satisfaction judgments and to arrive at limited number of explanatory variables, factor analysis was applied to the empirical data. Factor analysis identified three complex factors of customer satisfaction that are significant in seniorsÂ´ satisfaction with the chosen store. They are: convenience of shopping, value for money and store image and they collectivelly indicate the inter-relatedness of individual satisfaction attributes and explain the composite character and complexity of the term âsatisfactionâ. The findings confirm that participants tend to compromise among individual attributes in favour of an âoverall shopping experienceâ, which reinforces the belief that seniorsÂ´ rating of individual satisfaction attributes should be considered less important than that of a collective rating of satisfaction factors in judgment of shopping satisfaction. The research in this paper was conducted within the Research project VEGA 1/0224/15.",M

The objectives aim to identify the motivational elements of consumer of luxury goods, to correlate these reasons with the values represented by luxury products, and to exemplify the psychological factors determining the preference for luxury goods. The research hypotheses are: H1. Luxury goods consumption is associated with successful people; H2. Main psychological factors that determine the consumption of luxury products are related to the need of affiliation, recognition and appreciation, and values that are associated with luxury products are compliance, the need for uniqueness, social status and vanity. The study is divided into two parts. The first part is dedicated to an extensive literature review. Some of the most common psychological theories which underline consumer behavior and theoretical aspects of luxury products and their market will be presented. In the second part, the paper presents the methodological approach and the findings. Direct research covered a qualitative research, exploratory, based on two focus groups. Conclusions of this paper are consistent with the literature, meaning that luxury products are associated with success, satisfying needs of social integration, and membership of groups perceived as elitist, consumer ethnocentrism, and vanity.",M

An Evaluation of Aldi","The aims of this exploratory research are to investigate the viability of Aldiâs discount pricing strategy in the context of UK grocery retail and examine the impact of this approach on customerâs perceptions of and loyalty to the Aldi brand. Using 191 self-completed questionnaires with Aldi customers in Edinburgh, Scotland, the research found that discount pricing was a useful competitive strategy to drive footfall to the Aldi store particularly if combined with perceived value for money. The research revealed that price and value for money influenced brand perceptions but did not necessarily make customers loyal to the brand. With regards to the research hypotheses, H1 discount pricing plays an influential role in the brand loyalty of customers was not supported and H2 customers patronise Aldi because of price was supported. The variables age, gender, income, spending on groceries, preferred grocery retailer and frequency of shop proved significant in a customerâs patronage of Aldi. Given the context to this research, specifically the growth of discount retailing in the UK, mirrored by the increasing economic pressures on customers, the exploratory findings of this research should prove useful to academics researching the discount grocery retail sector and practitioners wishing to influence the brand loyalty and store patronage of their customers.",M

This research was conducted in Antalya Education and Research Hospital within the scope of Antalya Health Management. 1837 people in the field of health participated in the study. Because of the limited time, the sample group was chosen based on stratified sampling and composed of 407 employees. The data was gathered from the volunteers through interviews between 1st May and 31st of August, 2013. On those days 407 people were interviewed. In this research it was aimed to understand whether there is a relationship among fear, self-defence, protecting relationships or indifference and employee silence. Besides, one of the main objectives is to be able to explain whether there is a relation between organizational silence climate and employees silence behaviours. Based on the demographic characteristics of the sample group (age, sex, marital status, education, working period, task) it was tired to find out whether they are related to silence behaviours or not. Based on the analyses it was found that the upper management has a great influence on employeesâ silence behaviours but the effect of unit managers should also be considered. It was observed that employees generally show silence behaviours based on protecting themselves or based on fear. It can be said that there is a relationship between employeesâ silence behaviours and organizational silence climate. In terms of demographic characteristics, the silence behaviours of employees vary according to their demographic characteristics.",M

Somewhat later, sustainable tourism is being embraced as best practice by many countries around the world. This study identifies sustainable tourism from a business tourism perspective. According to the Croatian Tourism Development Strategy until 2020, business tourism is at the high quality and high yield end of the tourism spectrum. Business travellers pay more for services and thus, indirectly, pay higher taxes which can then be used to fund environmental or social programs, thereby benefitting the host. In addition, they are more environmentally sensitive and engage in green projects. The favourable geographical position in Central Europe and top quality conference facilities have made the hotels in Croatian town called Opatija particularly popular among organizers of meetings and congresses. This paper examines Opatija congress hotels and the level of implementation of environmentally responsible (green) innovations into business. The research was conducted in four-star Grand Hotel Adriatic in Opatija, interviewing top management about the environmental protection efforts in their everyday business. The analysis has revealed that, by following global trends and needs, the Grand Hotel Adriatic in Opatija respects the principles of green business and, most importantly, has the necessary knowledge and resource for organizing green meetings. Sustainability is no longer considered a passing fad in the hotel industry, but has become a task with many faces and names.",M

This concept is an economic phenomenon that is placed in a competitive context in which many businesses simultaneously compete and collaborate to gain different economic advantages. The economic advantages of successful real economic clusters has proves an important reason for the increased attention that this economic model has received from the scientific community and the governmental structures. Despite the advances in cluster research, its model remains a complex one and something that its hard to reproduce in a real economic environment. The paper highlights typologies of clusters, models of determinant factors and its characteristics by doing a survey of the cluster literature.

The paper presents also the characteristics of marketing mix, and refers to the three levels of public sector, which requires implementation of marketing, giving rise to the three concepts: macro-marketing specific to central public administration (Government, ministries, agencies), micro-marketing specific to individual public service providers (medical institutions, education units, public transport or public utility providers), and middle-marketing, which aims the marketing implemented in local public administration. In public sector, the prices are set independently of the demand volume or the companys positioning on the market. In addition, public service prices must be acceptable to all categories of customers, since many public enterprises are financed based on taxes paid by citizens to the state and because of the obligation to meet the customers needs, in terms of fairness and equality. The public services delivery focuses on two issues: the offer typology (mandatory or optional) and the level of consumer interactivity with front-line staff (high or low). The promotion of public services is largely determined by the activity of central government bodies and political environment. The most effective means of communication of public enterprise is the personnel, because the organizations image depends on their skills, courtesy and professionalism.",M

"Mihaela Constantinescu|Pacha Malyadri|S. Sirisha|Alina Filip","Loyalty Programs. Role, Structure and Potential Benefits","A loyalty program consists of an integrated system of marketing activities, aimed at increasing members loyalty by rewarding customers according to their purchasing frequency and amount spent. Loyalty schemes, customer clubs and sales promotion techniques are the most common relationship tools used in marketing practice. To join the program and receive a card, consumers must fill in a registration form, providing demographic, behavioural or even psychographic data. Loyalty schemes and customer clubs offer long lasting benefits to participants. Sales promotion techniques can be used both as tools to attract new customers, as well as instruments to stimulate repurchase behaviour. The potential of a loyalty scheme to achieve members depends mainly on rewards value, diversity and timing. Similar, the success of clubs depends on whether customers perceive enough relational benefits according to their personal interests. Although currently, loyalty programs have become very popular, programs effectiveness and implicitly the managerial decision to implement them are determined by different factors, including: homogeneity of supply and products purchase frequency, competition and consumer demand characteristics and the internal environment of the company.",M

Therefore, lost customers must be replaced and this process involves specific activities of prospects identification, communication channels selection and choice of the adequate supply for targeting potential customers. Processes of customer retention and customer relationship development are a logical continuation of customer acquisition plans. A retention strategy aims to maintain relationships with a highest proportion of the current customer base by decreasing their migration rate. A relationship development strategy involves additional efforts to increase the value or profitability of existing customers. These strategies are differently designed in relation with various customer segments, depending on their current attractiveness and their development potential. Retention strategies may be classified into two main categories, positive and negative, in light of the influence they have on customer repurchase behaviour and attitudes. Development objectives relate primarily to selling additional products and services to customers in the current database and selling higher value or higher profit margin products and services to the same customer segments.",M

"Carmen Acatrinei|Teodora Viviana Puiu","The Loyalty Card: Issues in Evaluating Loyalty Program Effectiveness","The present paper addresses the issue of correctly evaluating the impact of a loyalty program in retail stores when it is difficult to establish causality relations in what concerns joining a particular program. Since there are numerous costs related to technology, human resources and promotion associated with the choice of introducing a loyalty card, retail managers are faced with the very difficult and essential task to estimate the future benefits. The research conducted as a support for this article is aimed at demonstrating that there are no direct connections between some common methods of evaluating a customer's worth and their belonging to a loyalty program. A questionnaire has been applied to 132 respondents from Bucharest, half of them being part of a loyalty program at their favorite store and half at a store different to that which they are loyal to. The starting point of the research stems from prior controversy related to the actual reasons for joining such a program which can be found in scientific literature. Although the sample is a convenience one, the results indicate that loyalty may not be derived from the program itself and that it may be a prerequisite for joining it, as well as pointing out the fact that a longitudinal evaluation of customers is more appropriate for determining the impact of such a program. The findings can be used as a starting point for a more extensive store based experiment in which a customer's value before and after joining the program can be compared and used to evaluate the efficiency of that program. The usefulness of considering the causality relations proposed by this paper lies in the need of a retail store manager to correctly evaluate a time and money consuming CRM program.",M

Further, based on these forecasts, managers took a series of decisions which concern the resource allocation process of the company. Turmoil of the early '70s, which generated strong emergence of crises, of which we can remember: the oil crisis, energy crisis, high inflation, economic stagnation, strikes, unemployment growth followed by the recession, have forced managers to identify a completely different approach, from the original, in order to be able to manage the company. This new approach known as strategic planning had the advantage of providing companies with a general framework through which opportunities in the markets could be spotted more easily, and the threats could be defeated much more quickly and efficiently. The present paper aims to present the strategic planning process of the eco product portfolio. Moreover, the paper will emphasize the importance and the strategic implications of the eco product portfolio within a company.",M

Using cross-sectional Census data, we develop a two-stage model to predict an SMSAs median family income and poverty rate. The model allows the city's welfare level and industrial structure to affect its median family income and poverty rate directly.

In this paper the topic is studied in the context of foreign exchange scarcity and shown to be of crucial importance in determining the effects of government policy toward the MNE. The analysis proceeds by considering two alternative specifications of the output good. In the first case, the output is produced solely for domestic consumption. In the second, the good may be either sold domestically or exported. The effects of government policy in these two scenarios are radically different. These results suggest that the tradability of the output good is part of the explanation of the differing policies adopted by various developing countries towards foreign firms.",F

Empirical analysis indicates that a large number of factors underlie owner decisions regarding how to allocate seating to non-smoking use. Owners not only base their decision on the number of smokers in their community, but also consider customer occupations, presence of children, and whether businesses are located in college towns, as well as type of restaurant and whether the establishment has a general liquor license. Business age, numbers of seats, and membership in a corporate chain also underlie decisions made in the private market for accommodation. Government smoking restrictions that are less than bans overturn all of the factors that owners previously found critical to their choices of accommodation policies, except for the number of smokers in their client base. These findings indicate that an active private market in accommodation is consistent with diversity of smoking policies.",I

Convergence is faster, and equilibrium income levels higher, in regions with more social capital, using any of three measures: an index of civic community, the effectiveness of regional government, and citizen satisfaction with regional government. Our evidence also supports the idea that the post-1983 increases in regional dispersion of per capita GDP are due to the increased autonomy of regional governments being used more effectively in regions with higher levels of social capital. Both results confirm Putnam's view that social institutions matter, while also supporting a version of conditional convergence that makes catching-up a function of the size of the productivity gap between the richer and poorer regions.",R

We simulate the effect of abatement with a Heckscher-Ohlin-Samuelson model of a production on production externality. Both countries are Pigouvian and two levels of abatement effectiveness are endogenized. Although more effective pollution abatement increases total world production of both goods, trade decreases as a proportion of total world production. Our results with possibly greater pollution abatement by larger countries are useful in explaining Rose's (1991) findings that post-1973 increases in real output for large countries are associated with declines in international trade.",F

Multinomial logit estimates of individual college choice behavior show that the probability of attending college falls when loans replace grants, dollar-for-dollar, in the financial aid package. The estimates, however, also imply that this effect is small. Simulations of aggregate enrollment rates suggest that the increase in the proportion of aid comprised of loans provided only a minor negative inducement to enroll between 1972 and 1985.",I

Students in private colleges receive lower indirect subsidies, but significantly higher direct subsidies than do those in public colleges. The distribution of subsidies in the private sector is distinctly pro-poor, but this is not true in the public sector. Other findings include higher subsidies for undergraduates studying at four year colleges than for those in universities and significant saving of public funds on middle and upper-income students studying in private institutions.",I

Incorporating political economy factors in a model of trade with imperfect competition in segmented markets, this paper reaches two conclusions: First, that preferential arrangements which divert trade away from the rest of the world are more likely to be supported politically, and second, that such preferential arrangements will reduce member country incentives for multilateral liberalization. It is also argued that in some cases this reduction in incentives could be critical: Multilateral liberalization that is initially feasible could be rendered infeasible by preferential arrangements. The larger the trade diversion resulting from the preferential arrangement, the more likely this will be the case.",F

"Jean-Luc Dubois|Isabelle Droy","L'observatoire : un instrument pour le suivi de la pauvreté","Poverty reduction is one of the major objectives of the current public policies. Monitoring poverty is twofold : (i) a static component aims at identifying and characterising the various forms of poverty, and (ii) a dynamic component aims, in a comprehensive way, at understanding their evolutions. The multidimensional aspect of poverty, and substitutions occurring among the various dimensions, make the search of the poverty determinants quite difficult. New investigation tools combining quantitative and qualitative approaches are then required to investigate poverty groups over large periods. For this objective, the observatory appears to be an appropriate monitoring tool: based on an independent structure collecting permanently information on specific population groups, it produces regular data on the situation and behaviour of these groups, for a set of users. One may distinguish among to types of observatories: the synthetic observatory gathering diverse information from various sources for a specific thematic objective, and the field observatory which, as in the Malagasy case, collects panel data on rural peculiar population. This efficient investigation tool needs, however, methodological input to improve its statistical represensativity and to be kept simple as information requirement is increasing with its functioning.

We focus on poverty profiles depicting poverty duration, recurrence and persistence and, then, on the trigger events (income, demographic, labour market) associated with movements into and out of poverty, using a modified version of the Bane and Ellwood (1986) framework of event analysis. Multivariate logit analysis is employed in order to identify the socioeconomic factors affecting transitions into and out of poverty. Cross-country differences, as well as differences in poverty dynamic trends between the two periods, are examined. Poverty profiles show a consistency with the welfare regime typology during the period 1994-2001, but the results are not entirely clear in the pre-crisis period. The results differ significantly across countries when the events associated with poverty exits and entries are examined in detail, although five general patterns emerge: a) In both periods, income events and especially changes in headÃÂ¢Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s labor earnings seem to be highly associated with poverty transitions in all countries, but more so in the Mediterranean countries, while demographic events seem to be relatively more important in Northern countries; b) Employment events are more important for ending a poverty spell than unemployment events for starting a poverty spell; c) The importance of second income earners (finding a job or increasing earnings) for bringing the household out of poverty was established in both periods; d) The demographic events have a stronger effect in the EU-SILC than the ECHP for poverty entries and weaker for poverty exits; e) The socioeconomic characteristics of the household and the household head present a rather similar patterns across countries in both periods examined.",I

Venables","Multinational Firms in the World Economy","Depending on one's point of view, multinational enterprises are either the heroes or the villains of the globalized economy. Governments compete fiercely for foreign direct investment by such companies, but complain when firms go global and move their activities elsewhere. Multinationals are seen by some as threats to national identities and wealth and are accused of riding roughshod over national laws and of exploiting cheap labor. However, the debate on these companies and foreign direct investment is rarely grounded on sound economic arguments. This book brings clarity to the debate. With the contribution of other leading experts, Giorgio Barba Navaretti and Anthony Venables assess the determinants of multinationals' actions, investigating why their activity has expanded so rapidly, and why some countries have seen more such activity than others. They analyze their effects on countries that are recipients of inward investments, and on those countries that see multinational firms moving jobs abroad. The arguments are made using modern advances in economic analysis, a case study, and by drawing on the extensive empirical literature that assesses the determinants and consequences of activity by multinationals. The treatment is rigorous, yet accessible to all readers with a background in economics, whether students or professionals. Drawing out policy implications, the authors conclude that multinational enterprises are generally a force for the promotion of prosperity in the world economy.<p>",F

It traces Treasury Secretary William Gibbs McAdoo's triumph over a monetary crisis at the outbreak of World War I that threatened the United States with financial disaster. The biggest gold outflow in a generation imperiled America's ability to repay its debts abroad. Fear that the United States would abandon the gold standard sent the dollar plummeting on world markets. Without a central bank in the summer of 1914, the United States resembled a headless financial giant. William McAdoo stepped in with courageous action, we read in Silber's gripping account. He shut the New York Stock Exchange for more than four months to prevent Europeans from selling their American securities and demanding gold in return. He smothered the country with emergency currency to prevent a replay of the bank runs that swept America in 1907. And he launched the United States as a world monetary power by honoring America's commitment to the gold standard. His actions provide a blueprint for crisis control that merits attention today. McAdoo's recipe emphasizes an exit strategy that allows policymakers to throttle a crisis while minimizing collateral damage. <i>When Washington Shut Down Wall Street</i> recreates the drama of America's battle for financial credibility. McAdoo's accomplishments place him alongside Paul Volcker and Alan Greenspan as great American financial leaders. McAdoo, in fact, nursed the Federal Reserve into existence as the 1914 crisis waned and served as the first chairman of the Federal Reserve Board.",I

One of the main findings is that the observed increase in intra-industry trade between the United States and NAFTA is almost entirely due to two-way trade in vertical differentiation. Another important finding is that the share of horizontal intra-industry trade has increased significantly during this period, although vertical intra-industry trade continued to be dominant in the U.S.-NAFTA IIT Trade. Among the industry-specific variables, product differentiation, vertical product differentiation, and product quality differences are found to have a positive effect on all three types of IIT shares. Industry concentration and industry size are found to have a negative and statistically significant effect on all three types of IIT share.",F

In order to analyze empirically the impact of logistics on trade, two kinds of logistic indicators are considered: hard-ware and software indicators. A gravity model augmented with hard-ware and software variables is estimated. Moreover, geographical and social variables are also included as determinants of trade flows. Hard-ware indicators represent overland and maritime infrastructure endowments, and also how well countries are connected in the world economy, and software indicators reflect the logistics management performance in different countries. The results of this research indicate that investing in logistics leads to improve and maintain the level of competitiveness.",F
"Stephen J. Schmidt|Karen Scott","Reforming Reforms: Changing Incentives in Education Finance in Vermont","In 1997, Vermont passed Act 60, which reformed its education finance system to achieve greater equality of spending. The reform encouraged wealthy towns to reduce spending; it was politically unpopular and was replaced, in 2004, by Act 68. We analyze the spending incentives created by the two acts and estimate the effects the change will have on spending inequality. Act 68 reduces tax prices for education spending in all towns, but reduces them disproportionately for wealthy towns. It increases education spending in Vermont but also increases inequality of spending. Because spending is inelastic with respect to tax prices, the increase in inequality is small relative to existing inequality. Our findings demonstrate that understanding the way towns respond to financial incentives, economically and politically, is critical in designing successful reforms. They suggest that it is difficult to maintain finance systems that give wealthy towns strong incentives to spend less or subsidize poorer towns. Using state revenues to subsidize schools achieves nearly asmuch equality as more explicit attempts to force wealthy districts to share resources. © 2006 American Education Finance Association",I
"Michael A.

Based on a detailed analysis of judicial and other critiques of the state of the art of costing-out studies, this policy brief recommends specific mechanisms for defining the outcome standards for these studies, more precise means for identifying the extent to which students with special needs require extra resources, ways to minimize political bias and manipulations, and the use of quality education models to integrate efficiency and accountability considerations into the basic cost analysis. More extensive public engagement and continuing judicial oversight will be necessary to ensure the credibility and legitimacy of the ultimate judgments that result from these studies. © 2006 American Education Finance Association",I
"Deborah Fletcher|Lawrence W.

We estimate the determinants of school spending in a median voter model, comparing four assumptions about how the elderly influence the identity of the median voter. Using a county-level panel, we find that elderly preferences are best characterized by assuming all elderly or all elderly migrants vote with the poor. Having more elderly results in a median voter who is further down the community's income distribution. This median voter is poorer, which lowers preferred school spending, and faces a lower tax price, which raises preferred school spending. The evidence suggests that the income effect is slightly larger than the price effect, so the elderly on net cause a very small drop in spending. Thus the widespread concern about the negative impact of population aging on school funding seems to be misplaced. © 2008 American Education Finance Association",I
"Randall Reback","Entry Costs and the Supply of Public School Teachers","This article examines the impact of entry costs on the likelihood that recent college graduates will become public school teachers. I combine Barron's ratings of college selectivity, data on the types of teacher certification programs offered by colleges, and NELS data that track members of the high school class of 1988 into college and into the workforce. Restricting the sample to individuals who were not considering teaching careers when they were high school seniors, I estimate the marginal effect of the availability of undergraduate teacher certification programs on the likelihood that these individuals will become teachers. The results suggest that graduates from highly selective colleges are very sensitive to entry costs related to the number of years of schooling required for certification, while graduates from less selective colleges are not marginally influenced by these costs. © 2006 American Education Finance Association",I

A majority of those leaving the classroom remained employed by public school districts. Among teachers in grades 48 leaving for other industries, a 1 standard deviation increase in estimated value added to student math and reading achievement is associated with 68 percent higher earnings outside teaching. The relationship between effectiveness and earnings is stronger in other industries than it is for the same groups of teachers while in the classroom, suggesting that current teacher compensation systems do not fully account for the higher opportunity wages of effective teachers. © 2012 Association for Education Finance and Policy",I

No Child Left Behind's (NCLB) status and safe harbor measures have been criticized for being unfair and unreliable, respectively. In response to such criticism, in 2005 the federal government announced the Growth Model Pilot Program, which permits states to use projection models (a type of growth model) in their accountability systems. This article uses historical longitudinal data from a large school district to empirically show the inaccuracy of one state's projection model, to demonstrate how projection models are very similar to NCLB's original status measure, and to contrast projection models with value-added models. As policy makers debate the reauthorization of NCLB, this research can provide guidance on ways to improve the current measurement of school performance. © 2012 Association for Education Finance and Policy",I
"Kevin Stange","Ability Sorting and the Importance of College Quality to Student Achievement: Evidence from Community Colleges","This article examines the effect of institutional quality on the educational attainment of community college students, a large group that has been mostly overlooked in previous work. The effect of institutional quality is generally difficult to separate from that of student ability because more capable students usually sort into better colleges. A detailed analysis of student sorting reveals this not to be the case among community college students, for whom college quality is effectively determined by factors other than their aptitude. This facilitates identification of school quality effects. I find that community college quality (as measured by instructional expenditure per student and several other measures) has no impact on community college students' educational attainment. States and colleges should seek to identify other factors that may be more influential. © 2012 Association for Education Finance and Policy",I
"Dominic J.

High school students are increasingly underprepared for transition into college-level course-work. One new approach to high school redesign, early college, seeks to address these issues. The model features a rigorous academic course of study that engages students in college-level work in grades nine through fourteen. Early college is a subset of dual enrollment programs providing opportunities for students to complete high school and college credits with the same courses. The goal is to prepare students academically for college-level coursework while easing the transition to higher education. Early college offers promise in directly addressing student academic performance, attrition rates, and readiness for college, but further research is needed to determine its efficacy and scalability. © 2007 American Education Finance Association",I

Using a thirteen-year panel of North Carolina public schoolteachers, I find that less qualified and less effective teachers move to charter schools, particularly if they move to urban schools, low-performing schools, or schools with higher shares of nonwhite students. It is unclear whether these findings reflect lower demand for teachers credentials and value added or resource constraints unique to charter schools, but the inability to recruit teachers who are at least as effective as those in traditional public schools will likely hinder charter student achievement. © 2012 Association for Education Finance and Policy",I

In this article we use value-added methods to examine the relationship between a school's effectiveness and the recruitment, assignment, development, and retention of its teachers. Our results reveal four key findings. First, we find that more effective schools are able to attract and hire more effective teachers from other schools when vacancies arise. Second, more effective schools assign novice teachers to students in a more equitable fashion. Third, teachers who work in schools that were more effective at raising achievement in a prior period improve more rapidly in a subsequent period than do those in less effective schools. Finally, we find that more effective schools are better able to retain higher-quality teachers. The results point to the importance of personnel and, perhaps, school personnel practices for improving student outcomes. © 2012 Association for Education Finance and Policy",I

Students subjected to the policy were retained in the third grade, were required to be assigned to a high-quality teacher during the retained year, and were required to attend summer school. Exposure to these interventions has a statistically significant and substantial positive effect on student achievement in math, reading, and science in the years immediately following the treatment. But the effect of the treatment dissipates over time. Nonetheless, we find that the effect of remediation under the policy on academic achievement is statistically significant and of a meaningful magnitude several years after the student is exposed to the intervention. Though we cannot completely separate the differential effects of the treatments attached to the policy, we provide some evidence that assignment to a higher-quality teacher in the retained year is not the primary driver of the policys effect. © 2012 Association for Education Finance and Policy",I

We describe the philosophy and the mathematics that underlie the approach and apply\break the proposed model to data from 362 U.S. public four-year colleges and universities. The model provides incentives to institution administrators to eliminate wasteful spending and increase positive outcomes while maintaining educational quality and research productivity. The institutions in our study spent $96.74 billion, and states would reimburse $88.02 billion. Thus efficiency-based funding would reduce state government expenditures on these institutions by $8.72 billion, or approximately 9.0 percent. Efficiency-based funding is politically viable, as demonstrated by North Carolinas successful use of this approach in pupil transportation operations since 1994. The model will be of interest to state legislators, state education officials, and others who are concerned with funding formulas for institutions of higher education. © 2012 Association for Education Finance and Policy",I

The present study utilizes nationally representative data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal StudyBirth Cohort to examine relations between the ECERS-R and children's academic, language, and socioemotional functioning at age five years. After using a rich set of controls, we found little evidence that the ECERS-R related to children's development.

TAP is a comprehensive school reform model designed to attract highly effective teachers, improve instructional effectiveness, and elevate student achievement. We use a panel data set to estimate a TAP treatment effect by comparing student test score gains in mathematics in schools that participated in TAP with student test score gains in non-TAP schools. Ordinary least squares estimation reveals a positive TAP treatment effect on student test score gains in the elementary grades, with weaker but still positive point estimates in the secondary grades. When estimation methods control for selection bias, the positive effect remains at the elementary level, but most estimates for grades 6 through 10 turn negative. Our findings are qualified by the lack of information on the fidelity of implementation across TAP schools and on variation in features of TAP programs at the school level. © 2014 Association for Education Finance and Policy",I

From the food we eat to the diseases we conquer to our understanding of how we think and behave, we have profited enormously from an approach that marries our models of the world with tests of their validity through systematic variation to determine cause and effect. These same tools of thought and action are no less critical to the advance of education than to medicine, agriculture, psychology, or transportation. There has been impressive growth in the use of experimental methods in education over the past decade. As a result, much more is known today about what works and what does not. Future progress will be enhanced by research that better explicates process: linking trials to administrative data; serving the interest of local and state officials in examining the impact of their policies and practices; better preservice training for education practitioners in the logic and value of rigorous research; and more generous federal funding for the research enterprise. © 2012 Association for Education Finance and Policy",I

The solutions to those challenges may be instructive for experimenters who wish to study future interventions at the student or classroom level.

Recent experience evaluating a randomized need-based financial aid intervention highlights some of our arguments and guides our outline of the circumstances under which the examination of mechanisms and heterogeneous impacts is particularly important. Comprehensive experiments can enhance research productivity by increasing the number of theories both tested and generated and can advance policy and practice by exploring the conditions under which interventions will be most successful in scale up.

"Patrick Walsh","When Unified Teacher Pay Scales Meet Differential Alternative Returns","This paper quantifies the extent to which unified teacher pay scales and differential alternatives produce opportunity costs that are asymmetric in math and verbal skills. Data from the Baccalaureate and Beyond 1997 and 2003 follow-ups are used to estimate a fully parametric, selection-corrected wage equation for nonteachers, which is then used to predict the wages that teachers would have received in a nonteaching career. The difference between actual teacher salaries and this prediction can be considered the opportunity cost of teaching. Moving up one standard deviation in math SAT score increases the opportunity cost of teaching by $1,500 to $2,000 four years after college, rising to $3,000 to $3,800 ten years after college. Moving up one standard deviation in verbal SAT score increases the opportunity cost by $300 four years after college, and by $1,300 ten years after college.

The data set follows students from kindergarten to grade 5, a period during which racial gaps in test scores increase rapidly. Teacher assessments comprise up to twenty items measuring specific skills. Using a unique within-student and within-teacher identification and while controlling for subject-specific test scores, I find that teachers do assess same-race students more favorably. Effects appear in kindergarten and persist thereafter. Robustness checks suggest that: student behavior does not explain this effect; same-race effects are evident in teacher assessments of most of the skills; grading Òon the curveÓ should be associated with lower assessments; and measurement error in assessments or test scores does not significantly affect the estimates. © 2014 Association for Education Finance and Policy",I

While a large and growing literature has sought to estimate the impact of these schools on student achievement, comparatively little is known about demand for the policy itself. Using election returns from three consecutive referenda on charter schools in Washington State, we weigh the relative importance of school quality, community and school demographics, and partisanship in explaining voter support for greater school choice. We find that low school quality--as measured by standardized tests--is a consistent and modestly strong predictor of support for charters. However, variation in performance between school districts is more predictive of charter support than variation within them. At the local precinct level, school resources, union membership, student heterogeneity, and the Republican vote share are often stronger predictors of charter support than standardized test results. © 2011 Association for Education Finance and Policy",I

Assignment to remediation is generally made on the basis of performance on a placement exam. When students are required to take a placement exam prior to enrolling in college-level courses, assignment to remediation may dissuade students from actually going to college. This is because remediation could increase the time required to complete a degree (because remedial courses do not count toward academic degrees), and also because being identified as needing remediation might have stigma effects or provide students with new information about their unsuitability for college. This paper examines this issue empirically using administrative data from Texas. Using regression discontinuity methods, we find that students whose placement exam scores would require them to be in remediation are no less likely to enroll in college than are students who score just above the remediation placement cutoff.",I

"Christine Piette Durrance|Melanie Guldi","Maternal Bed Rest and Infant Health","Negative shocks to early child health influence both short- and long-run outcomes. Interventions prior to birth, rather than early in childhood, may reduce the probability or the severity of the shock and may be relatively cost effective. One such intervention, bed rest during pregnancy, is frequently prescribed to reduce the likelihood of preterm birth. Premature infants experience worse average initial infant health than full-term infants and these differences may persist into adulthood without mediation. Recent medical literature on the efficacy of bed rest is mixed, but tilts towards a negative or zero relationship between bed rest and infant health, suggesting that this intervention does not improve initial health status. This is not surprising given the difficulty of navigating a crucial threat to identification: conditions leading to bed rest recommendations are correlated with infant health. We investigate this question using Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) data. Among women who experience a medical issue during pregnancy, we compare outcomes of infants born to mothers who are observationally similar yet differ in whether they are recommended bed rest. Using OLS and matching methods, we find a positive relationship between bed rest and the likelihood of low birth weight and prematurity (consistent with prior medical literature). Yet our results also show that bed rest decreases the incidence of very low birth weight (at least â15.4 percent), very premature outcomes (at least â7.7 percent), and a reduction for infant death. We provide additional evidence that suggests bed rest shifts initial health status upward. Our back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest that when accounting for cost savings over both the short and the long run, bed rest may be more cost-effective treatment than post-birth interventions.",I
"Jean M. Abraham|Roger Feldman|Peter Graven","Employersâ Changing Economic Incentives to Offer Health Insurance under the Affordable Care Act","The employer's decision to offer health insurance depends on how much workers value insurance relative to wages, and that value is likely to vary, given the composition of the establishment's workforce and economic incentives such as the preferential tax treatment of premiums for employer-sponsored insurance (ESI). Using the 2008â10 MEPS Insurance Component augmented with information from other sources, we generate new estimates of employersâ price-sensitivity of offering insurance. Our results suggest that small and medium-size employers are sensitive to changes in the tax price of insurance, with small employers exhibiting the largest price-sensitivity. Workforce composition and local labor market conditions also influence employer offers. With these model estimates, we predict how provisions of the Affordable Care Act (ACA)âincluding the employer shared-responsibility requirement, premium tax credits for exchange-based coverage, and the individual mandateâaffect the probability of offering ESI. Findings from this study can inform policy discussions about the implications of ACA provisions as well as subsequent reforms focused on the tax-exempt status of ESI premiums.",I

African Influence and the International Access and Benefit-Sharing Regime","In 2010, at the tenth Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), Parties adopted the Nagoya Protocol on Access and Benefit-sharing (ABS). The adoption is the result of a long set of negotiations on the making of an international ABS regime, aiming to share benefits arising from the utilization of genetic resources in a fair and equitable way. However, the conditions for this fair and equitable benefit-sharing lie in a decision-making process that is similarly fair and equitable, i.e., governed by the principles of procedural justice. This article traces the participation of the supposedly most disadvantaged participants in the ABS negotiations: the African countries. It shows that these countries managed to have more influence than expected in light of their economic and demographic weight. It then explores the procedural and institution-based sources underlying this influence and draws lessons from the African experience in the ABS negotiations with regard to international procedural justice.",F

A View from Inside the Black Box","Empirical studies of peer effects rely on the assumption that peer spillovers can be measured through observables. However, in the education context, many theories of peer spillovers center around unobservables, such as ability, effort, or motivation. I show that when peer effects arise from unobservables, the typical empirical specifications will not measure these effects accurately, which may help explain differences in the magnitude and even sign of peer effect estimates across studies. I also show that under reasonable assumptions, these estimates cannot be applied to determine the effects of regrouping students, a central motivation of the literature.

Well-known examples are quotas, per unit tariffs, and, in part, transportation costs. In spite of this, we have no broad and systematic evidence of the magnitude of these costs. In this paper, we develop a new empirical framework for estimating additive trade costs from standard firm-level trade data. Our results suggest that additive barriers are on average 14%, expressed relative to the median price. The point estimates are strongly correlated with common proxies for trade costs. Using our microestimates, we show that an additive import tariff reduces welfare and trade by more than an equal-yield multiplicative tariff.",F

We use 775 women from the core sample of Add Health who had a friend with a teen pregnancy. We find a sizable negative treatment effect: a close friendâs teen birth is associated with a 6 percentage point reduction in the likelihood of own teen pregnancy and childbearing. There is evidence that this effect operates through a learning mechanism by changing beliefs regarding early childbearing. Effects of teen pregnancy prevention policies may be partially offset by reductions in the opportunities for social learning.

One possible reason is that the principal may have incentives to offer higher rewards when she knows the task is difficult. Our experiment tests if high rewards embody such bad news and if this is correctly perceived by their recipients. Our design allows us to decompose the overall effect of rewards on effort into a direct incentive and an informational effect. The results show that participants correctly interpret high rewards as bad news. In accordance with theory, the negative informational effect coexists with the direct positive effect.

"Loreli C.

The data were reassembled into (1) border procedures, (2) individual barriers, (3) broad categories of barriers, and the results ranked in terms of incidence and significance. Border procedures such as unofficial facilitation fees, tedious goods declaration, poor information on procedures, difficult release of goods, and complex refund and appeals process were the most widespread and serious. Logistics businesses were similarly affected by lengthy documentation, burdensome inspection, varying goods nomenclature, facilitation fees, poor regional coordination, and inefficient clearance. Across all types of barriers, for the goods sector, Customs procedures and their manner of implementation were prevalent, while quantity control measures, official and unofficial fees, and technical standards were significant. For the services sector, the operator's licensing requirement was the most common and severe, while high excise taxes, user fees, lengthy visa procedures, and market limits were further impediments. Logistics operators confirmed the singular importance of Customs procedures particularly time consuming documentation, followed by foreign ownership and transport-specific limitations. Time and monetary costs of complying were substantial.",F

This report examines how much Hong Kong's accession to ACFTA will impact on the trade in goods between ASEAN and China. It is likely that the direct impact of Hong Kong's accession will be minimal on the trade in goods since re-exports account for 96.3% of Hong Kong's total exports, indicating that the value of Hong Kong-origin products is marginal. However stock operations using movement certificates (MCs) in Hong Kong, which cannot be carried out in non-members of ACFTA, will facilitate the trade in goods between China and ASEAN. As such stock operations are generally carried out in places located near to final destinations, Hong Kong's accession will facilitate further ASEAN exports to China.",F

Information on costs is used for the calculation of product cost, and on expenses - to determine the financial results of the company's activities. In these two cases, the amount of costs may differ. The company does not include all its expenses in the self-cost. At the same time, there may be production in progress at the beginning and at the end of the reporting period. To determine the financial results, the self-cost of products sold is taken. The products can be manufactured not only in the reporting period, but also in the previous period. Often there are cases where not all products manufactured in the reporting period are sold in the same period.

Firstly, the theory commonly known as «Corporate Social Performance», a model that stems from the social theory. Secondly, the «Shareholder Value Theory», or «Fiduciary Capitalism», which is closely related with neoclassic economics. Thirdly, the «Stakeholder Theory» based on rationalist philosophical and ethical theories. Finally, «Corporate Citizenship» which derives from a metaphor from political philosophy and which uses an approach similar to that of political studies. Considering the limitations of these theories, it seems necessary to develop a more global theory of CSR, one that goes beyond the approaches taken from social sciences (sociology, economics, and political studies) and that surpasses the rationalistic ethics of some current propositions.",M

However, Amazonian urban networks have several characteristics that should be studied without euphoria, because of some peculiarities that deserve to be explored in greater depth. Even though there is an urban hierarchy that seems to be similar to the other regions of the country, with clearly distinguishable regional and local centers, the various urban hierarchical levels have different demographic, spatial and socioeconomic dynamics. The fragility of the Amazonian urban networks is related to the creation of barriers for the flows of people, goods and services, like: a) the great distances that separate the capital cities from the other towns and hamlets; b) the lack of transport and communication infrastructure in large areas of the Amazon territory; c) the large proportion",R

The Vickery methodology (1977), in which poverty isoquant curves are built for each type of family structure, is used to identify the proportion of generalized poverty. The percentage of involuntarily and voluntarily poor families is also estimated. Among the results obtained, it can be seen that poverty rates increase significantly when time is considered as a resource because working parents, especially in single-parent families, very often do not have the time to perform essential household chores. A higher percentage of generalized poverty is found among single-parent families and among those with a higher number of children. The highest percentage of involuntarily poor people is found among families with a high number of children.",I

A significant part of the empirical studies on this subject have concentrated on the analysis of existing productive agglomerations. In contrast, there are few studies that attempt (or are able) to identify the startup of these agglomerations. From the perspective of development policies, this gap is relevant, as it leads to favoring established agglomerations to the detriment of those that are in the early stages. Therefore, it is necessary to develop methodologies that enable us to overcome this deficiency. This is the aim of this paper. The authors propose a methodology for the identification of potential local productive agglomerations based on secondary data. Through the use of the Principal Component Analysis technique, a Concentration Index is elaborated, which is an indication of the potential of an industrial sector, in a specific region, to become a local productive agglomeration.",R

It refers to spatial characteristics of poverty, as well as its relation with the functioning of the labor market and the way family income is formed. The relatively sharp reduction in poverty and indigence from 2003 to 2004, the best result obtained since the Real Plan was implemented, constitutes the background for the analysis, although the impact of this reduction is spatially differentiated, more favorable in rural areas and less so in the São Paulo metropolitan area. The increase in family income is mainly due to the vigorous expansion of occupation, as the average labor income remained unchanged. Nevertheless, poor individuals benefited from the reduction in the returns to schooling, from the real increase in the minimum wage and from the wider scope of the social security net, which resulted in a more vigorous income increase at the base of distribution, thus leading to a reduction in inequality.",I

In order to do this, the Finger and Kreinin (1979) export similarity index (ESI) is calculated for the Brazilian and Chinese exports to MERCOSUL , which is disaggregated according to the similarities of the goods. The main results showed that the similarity between Brazilian and Chinese exports to MERCOSUL has increased over time, possibly due to an increase in the competition between these countries. However, when disaggregated from the Finger and Kreinin (1979) index, it is shown that the similarities between the exports occur, mainly, with vertically differentiated goods, where the quality of the goods exported by Brazil was superior to that of the goods exported by China. The results suggest that the competition between Brazil and China in the MERCOSUL is smooth, since the goods exported by these countries aim at different market segments.",F

An online questionnaire was conducted with fashion students at Reutlingen University: in total, 65 students participated in the survey. Paired samples t-test and other statistical analyses were applied to test research questions. Apart from this, the research paper is based on a literature review. Furthermore, the decision was taken to use a projective method in the form of a dummy fashion fTRACE website. Key findings of the survey are that participants give sustainable aspects a higher importance with a QR-code than without one. Participants who prefer a product with detailed information experience a âpositive shopping feelingâ when provided with transparency via a QR-code. âOriginâ, âproductionâ and âqualityâ were rated of higher importance by those participants. These findings suggest that, transparency provided through the application of a QR-Code in stores influences the consumersâ perception of sustainability.

Stratified random sampling was used to select a sample of 320 companies drawn from the target population of 1,470 limited companies. Data was collected using structured questionnaire, coded, keyed and analyzed quantitatively using both descriptive and inferential statistics. The study findings showed that tax audits had the highest positive effect on level of tax compliance followed by tax rate, fines and penalties. Tax incentives and level of actual income had the least positive effect on tax compliance .Based on these findings, the study concludes that reducing tax rate, ensuring Kenya Revenue Authority tax auditors to educate taxpayers; enforcing fines and penalties, provision of tax incentives and considering the level of actual income of the taxpayers will improve tax compliance. The study recommends that Kenya Revenue Authority management can improve the level of tax compliance by ensuring favorable and fair tax rates. Tax audits findings should be made available to the taxpayers, while fines and penalties need to be enforced effectively. The authority should also improve tax incentives and consider level of income of the taxpayers in its policy formulation. All these can be achieved through an elaborate taxpayerâs education.",M

This paper analyzes weather Kuwaiti male and female leaders differ in their leadership behavior. Explorative approach is applied for this research study. This study is based on a small sample in Kuwait and based on a self-rating of managers in Kuwait. In our study, we used similar approach as Eagly and Johannesen-Schmidt (2001) â rating was done through subordinates, peers and superiors â this would help to have more in-depth analyses. The quantitative analysis involves 62 leaders (38 male, 24 female) from different industries in private and governmental sector in Kuwait. Results indicated no major differences in leadership behavior by gender in Kuwait, which is similar to outcome of some studies conducted in western countries. It should be highlighted that the percentage of male and female respondents varied between different organizations. Future research should emphasis on equal sampling. It would be also interesting to analyze the difference in male or female dominated industries. This study offers knowledge for developing leadership skills in Kuwait. Very few studies have concentrated on difference in leadership styles outside Europe and North America, this study provides a new perspective in a different cultural context.",M

"Tessa Dahlmans|Frank Mathmann","Eating as Doing or Doing the Right Thing? The Influence of Locomotion and Assessment on Food Consumption Quantity","As overweight is becoming a serious worldwide health issue, a great amount of commercial books, programs and blogs are offering help in establishing healthy eating patterns. A factor that has commonly been blamed for overweight is the growth of portion sizes. This phenomenon of supersizing portions has created a distortion of portion sizes throughout the food industry and has been suggested to lead to overeating. The present study investigates the influence of locomotion and assessment orientations on food consumption quantities in conditions of distorted portion sizes. A survey was conducted in which participants (N = 75) watched a short movie whilst being presented with a distorted food portion. The results of this study show that when controlling for an individualâs level of hunger and movie engagement, locomotion decreases food consumption quantities. To conclude, it is suggested that when food portions are distorted locomotion assists in limiting an individualâs food intake.",M

"El Yachioui Maryam|Aomari Amina","Convergence between Marketing Approaches and the Aims of the Public Administrations: Towards an Optimization of the Citizen Relationship Management (CiRM) in Morocco","Traditionally, there is a tendency to think that administration and marketing are two antagonistic notions. Marketing is the science of designing the supply of a product according to the analysis of consumer expectations and taking into account the capacities of the organization as well as all the constraints of the socio-demographic, competitive environment, legal, cultural in which it evolves. For Butler and Collins (1994) marketing has shifted from transactional marketing, rather product-oriented to relational marketing, more client-oriented, which corresponds more to the expectations of public administrations regarding their relations with the citizen, especially the user. But in Morocco, there is a marketing myopia in the public sector. Indeed, this industry often complains about the lack of citizens' interest in their services and products. These citizens become more demanding and must be satisfied. This article thus has a twofold objective: first, to show wherein the marketing myopia in Moroccan Public Administrations lies, in order to define the heart of their business, and second, to propose a marketing mix for these administrations to optimize their Citizen Relationship Management (CiRM) and see how e-administration responds to a marketing approach.",M

"Alshahrani Bander Sayaf","Measuring Job Satisfaction Patterns in Saudi Arabiaâs Southern Regions Hospitals: Implications for Hospital Staff Retention","Saudi Arabia Southern Region hospitals have shortage of health professionals especially doctors. Retention of quality doctors and minimizing staff turnover has, therefore, become a major priority for hospitals. Job satisfaction is recognized as key factor influencing retention of doctors. In our paper special emphasis is put on doctors working is Southern Region hospitals of Saudi Arabia. By conducting correlation analysis we determine the most important factors conducive to job satisfaction. Results of the study indicate that opportunities for promotion have a strong link with job satisfaction, whereas relations with co-workers and attitude toward supervisor exhibited a moderately strong relationship with job satisfaction. The factors of nature of the work, compensations and benefits lack a significant link to overall job satisfaction. The findings imply that the health care service managers need to pay closer attention to the needs of their human resources, especially doctors, in order to not only minimize the doctors turnover but also to improve the organizationsâ performance. Additionally, introducing turnover risk programs as well as employee satisfaction programs within the hospitalâs management schemes have become a must. Saudi Arabian hospitals, especially those in the Southern Region, can make use of retention strategies to annihilate the unbalance caused by the doctorsâ high turnover",M

We review social media, social networks, and marketing literature that demonstrate the importance of social media and social networks in maximizing MSMEs competitive value through exploring the company-customer relationship, and the advantages and disadvantages that social media utilization brings. The findings suggest that micro, small and medium sized enterprises can reap benefits from executing an effective social media marketing strategy. These benefits encompass reducing overall marketing costs, improved customer service through social media, and achieving a competitive advantage. On the other hand, social networks have drawbacks that may affect MSMEs performance and decrease market share, such as time consumption and lack of feedback control. Therefore, MSMEs need to rethink about customer relationship management through building a conceptual and operational framework that provides both structure and flexibility.

Utilizing the rationale of institutional theory, stakeholder theory as well as upper echelons theory, this study devises a conceptualized model in explaining eco- innovation and uses questionnaire data from 288 enterprises in Wuhan city to test the hypothetical model through Structural Equation Modeling analysis. The study reveals that both institutional/stakeholder force and organizational force are significant triggers in enterprise eco- innovation, as the latter one mediates the effect of the former one. Supervisory support does not strengthen the relationship between institutional/stakeholder force and firm eco-innovation, yet weakens the relationship between organizational driver and eco-innovation. Conclusions imply that firm should prepare in terms of technological capability, scientific or social networking, resource base and specificity to better embrace eco-innovation, whereas governments should commit to optimize its regulation setting, law enforcement and various administrative and economic instruments to better incentivize enterprises to engage in eco-innovations",M

The method adopted is based on the Vector Error Correction Model (VECM). It examined a 256 observation for the duration 2000 â 2010. We found that FDI inflows have a significant variance to GDP. And the increase of level of carbon dioxide emissions is highly related to FDI and commodity imports in which GCC economies have not taken into account in their environmental consideration.",M
"Nela Steliac","The Labor Market in Romania and Interregional Disparities","The decrease of regional disparities represents one of the fundamental objectives of the regional development policy promoted by the EU; furthermore, the waves of enlargement of the EU deepened these differences even more. As a member state of the EU, Romania is actively involved in reducing the economic gaps by applying some regional development strategies and policies. The aim of this paper is to present the results of the labor market analysis from the perspective of the regional gaps, carried out based on some of its specific indicators. The sinuous evolution of the standard deviation for the analyzed indicators (except for the net average salary the standard deviation of which was permanently growing) revealed increase or decrease of the regional disparities for the entire period. However, in comparison to 1998, the regional gaps increased in 2013. The regional poles on the labor market have been as following: Bucharest-Ilfov region for the best values of the studied indicators, and Northeast region and Southwest Oltenia region for the lowest values.",M

This study examines why some IPOs companies have a positive, and some IPOs companies have a negative long-term cumulative abnormal return (CAR). KLCI index is used as a benchmark for measuring long-term performance of IPOs for sharia-compliant companies. The empirical results show that the long-term performances for sharia-compliant companies are performed better (16.81 percent) than their benchmark for CAR equal-weight and the result for CAR value-weight show a slightly outperformed their benchmark (-0.07 percent). The results also indicate that CAR for equal-weight and value-weight of IPOs for sharia-compliant companies are significantly higher over performing by 14.58 percent and 4.11 percent respectively in the year 2006. While the results in 2007 (-1.34 percent) and 2008 (-3.43 percent) for valueâweight are underperformed.

"Alexander M. Karminsky|Oleg S. Kozlov","Stress Testing of Retail and Corporate Segments of Russian Credit Market","The objective of the paper is to investigate and compare risk patterns in retail and corporate segments and assess the potential impact of macroeconomic shocks on loan quality. Banksâ monthly financial statements data for the period 2004 â 2012 are used. Firstly, we develop an indicator to measure institutionâs credit risk that reflects variance and average value of NPL corrected for loan loss reserves. It is used to compare the risk-return patterns of largest state-owned banks, and under our framework we identify how the strategies of various banks differ in retail and corporate loans, identifying âsafestâ and âriskiestâ institutions. Secondly, loan growth and credit risk sensitivity to macroeconomic shocks is analyzed using vector auto-regression. Macroeconomic shocks do not significantly increase NPL growth in the corporate segment. However, inflation and investment growth have a considerable impact on NPL growth in the retail segment (which is however almost three times less than the corporate). Based on these findings we conclude that there is no reason to expect rampant rise in corporate loan defaults in response to sudden changes in macroeconomic environment of Russia, though further growth of corporate loan segment increases credit risk, while the opposite is true about the retail sector.",M
"D.P.S. Chandrakumara","Prospects of Saving Mobilization in Underserved Settlements of the City of Colombo","The urban poor in Sri Lanka have been deserted by the financial institutions of the country. They have been undervalued and excluded from the banking sector since they live in underserved settlements. However, evidence from other countries proves that the urban poor can be successfully mobilized and included in the financial sectors as valuable customers of the banking institutions. Mobilizing the savings from them is the first step in such a process. Hence, the aim of this study is to identify the saving potential of the urban poor in Sri Lanka. The study was based on primary data collected by a questionnaire survey conducted in a sample of underserved settlements within the Colombo city limits. The study used descriptive statistics for analyzing the saving potential of the people. The study revealed that some people of these settlements already have financial links with compulsory and voluntary societies. Furthermore, a number of indicators of hidden and disguised savings could be found. Finally, the study found that savings can be mobilized from the urban poor if the formal institutions can approach them in a more responsive way with effective techniques.",M
"Mohammed Yelwa|S.A.J. Obansa Awe|Emmanuel Omonoyi","Informality, Inclusiveness and Economic Growth in Nigeria","The concept of inclusive growth requires analysis of how employment opportunities arise and change with growth process. Economic growth can be accompanied by an increase in informal employment. Informality may support growth by reducing labor cost and improving competitiveness. However, a well-functioning and regulated informal economy will be a critical prerequisite to achieve sustainable growth. In addition, a widespread informality with regard to employment, enterprise, and productive activities is frequently perceived as a barrier to full participation in the economy and as a hindrance to long-run economic development and poverty alleviation. This is because the link between, informality, growth and inclusiveness is not fully understood. Inclusive growth has been defined as growth that takes place in a context in which economic opportunities-including employment opportunities expand, the poorâs access to these opportunities improves, and inequalities are reduced. This paper seeks to investigate the impact of informal sector activities, inclusiveness and economic growth in Nigeria. A survey method will be use to collect data from 150 informal sector operators in Gwagwalada area council-FCT. Data will be collected using structured questionnaire and analyzed with multivariate Panel Logit model statistic in order to identify the perception of socio-economic impact of Informal sectors on economic growth in Nigeria. The findings revealed that informal sector operators has a positive and significant impact on growth in Nigeria; while poverty-mentality, illiteracy, high inflation, low infrastructure, access to credit, social safety nets and information dissemination are the major problems encountered by these institutions. The paper recommends among other things the education of the rural poor to embark on viable projects, infrastructural development and favorable government policies so as to regulate the sector becomes relevant",M

It is the one economy that is likely to sustain economic growth and development, enhance the productivity of nations for the general well-being of the citizenry. In the course of analyzing the Nigerian economy for the 21st century, several factors have shown that the economy is not globally competitive. Among the reasons for the poor competitiveness status of the economy include: macroeconomic instability, infrastructural failure, weak public institutions, poor quality of manpower, and slow pace of technological development among others. The paper concluded that there has to be some sort of structured national efforts directed at building institutions, enacting sustainable policies and restructuring the Nigerian economy in the light of emerging domestic and global challenges. The paper recommended immediate development of Agriculture, Solid Minerals, Tourism and the Service sectors of the economy. The paper also suggested that the private sector should be supported to develop as the engine of growth to drive the economy.

"Sharukh Tara|Sorab Sadri","Corporate Governance and Risk Management: An Indian Perspective","Companies need funds to finance their activities and as a result, there has been a need for accountability to protect the interests of those providing the funding. Companies are also managed by directors who act as agents of the shareholders. Under pressure to maximize wealth they are prone to excessive risk, reckless conduct or in extreme cases, blatant manipulation of accounting figures. The call for increased accountability grows louder every time there is a crisis in public confidence. Whether this is the stock market crash of 1929, for example, or the more recent high-profile collapses of a number of large firms such as Barings Bank, Enron Corporation and WorldCom, the resulting uncertainty has led to renewed interest in corporate governance practices. It is not only as a means of directing and controlling corporations but as a means of mitigating corporate risk. This paper bases on over a decadeâs research attempts to shed some light on this topic based on the Indian experience. Paper tries to bring out the fact that there is a significant relationship between corporate governance and the management of risk and that corporate governance is one of the main means by which a company can manage risk.",M

Small firms are vital in the development and growth of bottom billion economies and are part of solutions to social problems that Namibia experience, inter alia, high unemployment rate. In developing countries, it is estimated that 45% of formal sector workers belong to SMEs and about 24% of GDP is contributed by small firms. SMEs are known for the common characteristics such as responsiveness, strategic agility, and leanness in operations management that are often aimed to meet and exceed variations of market demands. Thus far, it is crucial to study such behavior of small firms responsible for their growth or demise in the contemporary markets where small firms are crippled by raspy competition from MNCs",M

Product risk can even lead to corporate crisis, mainly because of strategic threats. For the duration of the crisis, companies struggle to minimize the harm brought to their reputation and brand equity. This paper presents a new notion of measuring organizational success when dealing with product-harm crises. It introduces the concept of country of origin as a potential tool in managing the crisis as it gives a comprehensive overview of effects on perceptions and attitudes of consumers towards products from abroad. This can suggest that using positive associations of the country when building a strong brand creates consumersâ positive attitude and perception towards country of origin aspect of the brand. We think that even at the crisis time, perception, attitude, and behavior that lead to willingness of purchase are influenced by aspects related to country of origin. Thus, country of origin has been identified as an important factor that influences successful recovery from a product-harm crisis",M

Using resource based theory (RBT) the present model for sustainable strategy has been developed. On the basis of data collected, the key drivers of sustainability were developed. We used regression and correlation analysis for developing the final model. Â The study findings suggest that the drivers of GSCM are the environmental policy and the green human resource management (GHRM). This can be done by providing training for adopting sustainability practices. Besides this, another key driver is the sustainability criteria in supplier selection which was found to be enhancing the outcomes of sustainability. The model has practical and theoretical value as it proposes that management support for implementing the sustainability strategy in the organization is essential.

Consequently, offering an innovative and superior marketing mix for the customers is a necessary requirement for market competitiveness. Marketing operations and market orientation should, therefore, aim to boost the marketing innovation of hospitals. In this paper, we built a research framework to measure influence of market orientation on marketing innovation in Saudi Arabia hospitals. By determining the relationship between the market orientation factors, centralization, formalization and marketing innovation, organizations will know which aspect of market orientation to focus on. A six-step research framework has been proposed which will help to explain the impact of customer orientation, inter-functional orientation and competitor orientation on marketing innovation together with the moderating effects of centralization and formalization on those relationships. The findings of the future study may suggest an important role of market orientation for an effective innovation generation and business performance of hospitals in Saudi Arabia",M

A sample of six firms out of eleven food product firms listed on the floor of Nigerian Stock Exchange was studied. The study made use of secondary data generated from Annual Reports and Accounts of the sampled firms and the Nigerian Stock Exchange Fact book. The data was analyzed by means of descriptive statistics, correlation and regression analysis using STATA (version 12) package. The study reveals that board size and women on board show a significant positive association with corporate social responsibility disclosure of the sample firms. While managerial ownership shows a significant negative effect on corporate social responsibility disclosure. However, board independence indicates an insignificant association with corporate social responsibility disclosure. While the control variable (Size) shows an insignificant negative relationship with corporate social responsibility disclosure. Based on the findings, the study recommends among others, that firms in the food product should have a competent size of 9 to 15 of board members, so as to encourage corporate social responsibility disclosure. Also, the proportion of non-executive directors on the board should be maintained and the appointment should be strictly based on experience and expertise as this will also ensure more corporate social responsibility disclosure. Also, women participation on the board should be encouraged as much as possible since women may have different skills compared to their men counterpart as this will help in ensuring full disclosure of all CSR related information.",M
"Camilo Koch|Davit Mkhitaryan","Consumerâs Brand Choice Behavior for Luxury Cars in China","This paper introduces the aphorism Â«think globally, act locallyÂ» and examines consumer tendencies in the Chinese automobile marketplace based on the analysis of relevant local brands. Findings demonstrate significant consumer preferences for products related to the luxury category signifying the need for refining local marketing operations where performance of multinational corporations must match global standards as expected by local consumers. Car consumption has grown during the last years in China turning brand marketing into a critical variable that can forge an active place in consumerâs minds, or negative impact if a campaign is not well-implemented. The relevance of this subject result from the realities that brand marketing is one of the most important aspects of determining whether a brand succeeds or fails. Regardless of the benefits of the brand, poorly marketed brand can end in failure. Multinational corporations need to identify several factors to understand the benefits of branding such as the image and characteristics of the firm, the purpose of the brand, the consumers profile, the brandâs position within the marketplace, and the brandâs general impression. Once, multinational corporations entirely assume these aspects they can utilize brand marketing to market the benefits of the brand in any space in the marketplace. The investigation provides several recommendations to multinational corporations intending to enter Chinese market by utilizing brand marketing as a strategic tool to focus on consumer needs and preferences in the Chinese luxury automobile market.",M

In developing countries like Lao PDR in particular, enterprises are increasingly required to be internationally competitive through such efforts as developing human resources to deal with regionalization and globalization. Training is seen as a major way to develop human resources, but it has not yet been implemented intensively enough. Therefore, it is worth investigating the determinants of training in these firms. We utilize data from the Enterprise Survey 2013 by Deutsche Gesellschaft fÃ¼r Internationale Zusammenarbeit and analyze stratified random sample of 658 small and medium enterprises using ordinary least squares (OLS) and logistic regressions. The results are non-uniform among the different dependent variables, such as engagement in vocational training, the existence of training intention for entrepreneurs and employees, and skills variety of training premeditation for employers and employees. For instance, a gender of entrepreneur has a significantly positive effect on training implementation but an insignificant effect on training plan. Education of entrepreneur has an unconvincing effect on training execution but a significantly positive outcome on training will. Some other independent variables show more inconclusive but explainable results (e.g., firm size, competition problems, membership of a business organization, and age of entrepreneur). However, located in Vientiane Capital has a significant effect but firm-age and ethnicity of entrepreneur are insignificant. The results suggest to pay more careful attention to the potential differences among different training-related variables.",M

"Camilo Koch|Mikko Ranta","Hackschooling to Foster Creativity in Students in China","This paper proposes a method for refining the lack of creativity existent on middle schools in China. Actual teaching methods at schools do not focus on fostering studentâs imagination, setting efforts in other priorities when educating students from all ages. We examined and categorized the results of a quantitative examination applied to students and categorized feelings about their educational institution by mapping relations of pairs of data; students suggested several words and then selected two of which fitted on their accumulated emotions. Creativity theory and experts believe that kids have tremendous talents and schools squander them (Sir Ken Robinson, 2006). Schools are responsible for fostering studentâs ability to innovate but they are not improving significantly, and this is not particularly a country problem, oppositely it is a global situation. Due to this circumstance, we analyzed the educational cycle in a middle school case intending to find the mainstay relations between studentâs time consumption and studentâs creative output from the daily school routine. The essential role of parents in home teaching, and the possible effects that âhackschoolingâ or âhomeschoolingâ can have on studentâs life and education, are essential as expected explanation to the lack of creativity advocated by schools in the short and medium course. Finding better ways to accomplish the same goals outside of the educational establishment is fundamental. In a second procedure, we will examine the success of Finland in hackschooling as a comparison, and evaluate the chances of adapting and introducing Finland hackschooling principles in China as an innovation multiplier on childâ lives.",M

If the state is perceived in relation with the society, then what comes as a result of this relationship will be seen as Plexus. On the other hand, Nexus is the way the Albanian society perceives the relation between state and society mostly represented by the functioning of state, where the state is the central axis and the society has no influence on it. This derives mostly from the political culture which has been shaped during communism.

Three principal strategies, according to Porters generic strategy theory: cost leadership cost-focus and differentiation respectively, were tested in our research model. Quantitative empirical analysis of international strategy on a sample of 58 Chinese firms was conducted to determine strategies that lead to enhanced strategic performance. We utilized survey strategy encompassing questionnaire data collection.  The collected data was analyzed using SPSS statistical package. Inference statistics consisting of correlation analysis and multiple regression analysis were performed. Findings of the study suggest that cost leadership and differentiation strategies impact strategic performance significantly, whereas cost-focus does not. A value of appropriate international business strategy is illustrated by supporting a relationship between strategy and international performance. The originality of contributions of the study lies in the fact that the generic business strategies impact on strategic performance is tested on an international market on the sample of Chinese firms. These notions enrich existing body of knowledge on strategic management. Therefore, companies conducting their business operations internationally should consider forming and implementing strategies of differentiation and cost leadership to achieve optimal business results.",M

Managing demand and supply is not that naÃ¯ve as the supply chain is complicated by the outsourcing trend. This study aims to assess how brands in the fashion industry are managing their demand-supply chains (DSCs) by considering both trendy and regular product. This paper is based on the literature review of demand chain management (DCM) and also supply chain management (SCM) of the fashion industry. Also the research on demand-supply chain management (DSCM) is studied as a scope of demand-supply management in fashion industry. Textile and apparel processing stages are also studied to understand the manufacturing and supply chain complexity. The review identified that the degree of fashion sensitivity adopted by the retail brands influences their supply chain strategy. Fast fashion retailers urge to respond quickly and they need a flexible and responsive supply chain and contrariwise, others do need fast response but more efficiency focus with economy of scale. chains. The demand side aspects and supply side alignment will contribute insights on DSC organization in textile-apparel supply chain. Also textile and apparel manufacturers may have a clearer picture regarding the structure of retailers DSCs. The findings may also prove useful for them who are not aligned with the fast track concept, but yet supplying product in timely manner is their top priority. The co-ordination of complex and multidimensional textile-apparel supply chain with individual interest is still a concern and yet to be resolved.

The Spearman rank correlation coefficient was used for data analysis. This study found a significantly positive relationship between procedural justice and employees commitment to supervisor. We found that employees tend to easily identify with supervisors that implement fair procedures than those that do not and employees do study or evaluate their organizations justice climate to identify procedural injustice by comparing policies of different organizations. We concluded that fairness of procedures could reinforce a healthy justice climate and employees commitment to supervisor in turn. The justices of outcome and interaction depend mainly on the justice of procedures, as unjust procedures may not turn out a just outcome.

However, studies examining factors determining the customers' purchase decision made towards the online airline tickets established by the small businesses in the country are not available yet, especially those studies published in high-caliber journals. For this reason, this study aims to examine the effects of service quality, airline ticket price and promotion on customers purchase decision of online airline ticket provided by the small business so called Traveloka company in Jakarta, Indonesia. The statistical method used to examine the above research question is by applying a multiple linear regression analysis.  The model has one dependent variable that is customers purchase decision and three independent variables, namely, service quality, airline ticket price and promotion. Data were collected by using questionnaires distributed to 166 respondents of the online airline tickets customers of Traveloka in Jakarta. The statistical program to estimate the model is by using SPSS  version 20. The study found that the online airline tickets services by Traveloka have been widely known by the respondents under survey. They also knew the way how Traveloka sells the online airline tickets to them. The study also found that service quality and airline ticket price have positive and significant effects on purchase decision made by the Travelokas costumers. However, the promotion variable has no significant effect on costumers purchase decision. Therefore, it is a must for Traveloka company to give great attention to improve the service quality and price in making the customers decided to buy the online airline tickets. Otherwise, the Travelokas customers will find other online airline tickets services. If this is the case, this condition will further mitigate the business profit that potentially is obtained by the Traveloka company.  Thus, much remain to be done by the Traveloka company in order to sustain the value of the company.",M

Sales of store brands in the Southeast European markets have not picked up yet, making these markets a compelling space to study, analyze and predict the future of store brand growth and success. Thus, this study focuses on consumerâs attitudes towards store brands in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina â an emerging market, which is highly attractive for international retailers. The main objective of this study is to analyze and validate the profile of a consumer of store brands in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina in the context of personal care products. For the purposes of this study, the mall-intercept survey was carried out at selected hypermarket locations. Based on the extent to which consumers perceive themselves to be consumers of store brands, three consumer segments have been identified: heavy buyers, sometimes buyers and seldom buyers. These segments were then described in terms of perceived quality and price of store brands as well as demographic characteristics of respondents. The findings allow drawing some useful reflection about who are the buyers of store brands in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and what drives their preferences towards store brands. Thus, this study provides valuable information for both retailers and manufacturers toward the SRI",M

"Kresimir Cicak|Petar Soric","The Interrelationship of FDI and GDP in European Transition Countries","Theory states that the foreign direct investments (FDI) have multiple positive effects on a countryâs economy. Evidence can be sought from Central and Eastern European countries where FDI is seen as one of the main contributors to GDP growth. This paper examines the relationship between FDI and GDP growth rate in Croatia and other chosen European transition countries using bivariate VAR models. Based on the research conducted, it was found that FDI Granger causes GDP growth in most countries. This is especially true in Poland, Czech Republic and Hungary which have attracted a significant amount of FDI starting from 1990. The estimated VAR models for Latvia and Slovenia provide evidence that GDP causes FDI, corroborating the theory that investor are prone to stable macroeconomic conditions. This paper tries to make a comparative analysis of FDI-GDP link in New EU member states. Further research should certainly include other aspects such as the quality of the legislative system, labor productivity and labor costs, access to capital markets, etc",M
"Gofurov Ubaydulla","Creating a Favorable Business Environment: Case Study on Firm Registration Process in Uzbekistan","The development of national economy in many respects depends on conditions such as freedom and guarantees, privileges and preferences so that entrepreneurial activities prosper within a better entrepreneurial environment. While the development extent of entrepreneurial environment is defined by several indexes, the processes and documentation as a part of state registration of entrepreneurial activity have a special value among them. In this article, in consideration of exemplary entrepreneurial environment practices in different developed countries, the successes and shortcomings of Uzbek experience and some important theoretical rules on the creation of such favorable and friendly entrepreneurship conditions are discussed. We find that in order to increase the share of small business and entrepreneurship there is a need to systematically improve the mechanisms of state regulation of organization and registration processes of business entities. A system of incentives should be introduced in the registration process such as optimization of its time, increasing the number of business entities",M

Although SRI is present in emerging markets, very few studies to date have examined its reach within these markets and familiarity of investors with this concept. In our study we surveyed 300 Algerian investors in order to investigate reasons why SRI in Algeria is still low. The objective of this research is to analyze and put light on what are the reasons behind investorsâ choice of investments toward or against SRI and to provide some recommendations helping to promote SRI in Algeria. The results based on the questionnaire survey demonstrate that SRI is still not-known to lots of Algerian investors. It is also found that financial institutions and advisors have a positive impact by bringing SRI concept closer to investors.

The results show that in China there is a robustly significant negative relationship between the economic cycle and bank capital buffers. Insignificance of coefficient of the total amount of loans shows that Chinas commercial banks holding more capital buffer do not necessarily lead to a credit crunch phenomenon. Positive significant asset coefficient indicates the larger the size of the assets, the more inclined for China banks to hold more capital buffers, which is incompatible with too big to fall theory. The relationship between the loan loss provisions and capital buffers is not significant and this caused by Chinese commercial banks balance between the profit and cost perspective.",M

In many cases, like in the case used for this study; North Cyprus universities, the language used to teach and learn is English language. This therefore entails that on average, almost all students already speak at least 2 languages wherein they speak their own dialects, or cultural languages, while using English language proficiently to communicate with others, learn, study, and write examinations. Thus, in researching this, the aim is to see the extent to which the students are bilingual, or multilingual.

"Melika Husic-Mehmedovic|Emir Agic","Regional Approach to Luxury Market Segmentation: The Case Of Western Balkans","Nature of the luxury brand requires limited market in order to maintain exclusivity. Individual countries in the Western Balkans are not lucrative per se, therefore, regional segmentation is needed in the case of luxury brands. Countries of Western Balkan, i.e. Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Serbia and Slovenia are all post-socialist, post-war countries currently going through major transitions. Â Rather small markets are yet to be established in its final form politically, economically, socially and culturally and individually. Foreign investors and worldâs leading companies are concerned mainly about the size of the potential individual market. The main idea of this paper is to analyze luxury consumption in the Western Balkans region in order to identify some consumption patterns and to describe the regional luxury consumer. Broad study among 800 respondents in four countries defines demographics and buying intent of the luxury consumers. Moreover, this study identified luxury consumer region-wide and helps luxury brand managers to target those small countries together as a rather significant market segment of approximately 20.000 consumers. The region that has shared similar historical and cultural facts proved to have similar or the same luxury consumption patterns. This paper has significant practical value for the luxury brand managers and their segmentation of the Western Balkan countries. They will decide much easier to target this region knowing that consumers are sharing the same lifestyle and preferences regarding the luxury consumption. Main limitation of the research is the average income of the sample. However, the top market segment is always difficult to reach with surveys, therefore, qualitative approach might be used in the further studies in this regard.",M

While citizens of most economies do not have a say in legislations and policies of their countries towards reducing emissions, the only realistic way of having a say can be done through their behaviour towards reducing carbon footprints. This study seeks to study attitudes of educated Fijians towards environmental issues, particularly issues brought by tourism and Fijians intentional behaviour in reducing these impacts by minimising their carbon footprints. It concludes that tourism is not regarded as a high impact environmental issue owing to Fijians either lack of awareness or an intentional lack of awareness. Awareness campaigns in Fiji are generic in nature, as most mentioned behaviours were unspecific meaning most Fijians know what to do but do not know how.",M

For this purpose, we used both qualitative and quantitative research methods. We performed qualitative analysis of legislation in the field of innovation as well as the attitude of the government towards innovation processes. In order to quantify innovation activities in Bosnia and Herzegovina companies, we conducted survey questionnaire among profit-oriented companies who employ at least 10 people. The working hypothesis of the paper is that the authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina have a marginal role when it comes to encouraging the development and implementation of innovations and statistical monitoring of business innovation processes, which results in the lack of innovation activities in Bosnia and Herzegovina companies and has a negative impact on the business. Different parametric and non-parametric statistical tests were applied to test the stated hypothesis. Quantitative research has shown that a small number of enterprises continuously introduce new products/services which has negative impact on their performance. Conducted qualitative research has shown that the role of government in promoting and developing the acquired competitive advantages such as knowledge and innovation in Bosnia and Herzegovina is marginalized.

In present day, we can see the increase of their importance in the global dimension. This process is more and more visible from year to year and takes place on every continent. The regional policy is a special instrument, which serves for realization of topics in this subject. The assurance to equalize and permanent development, is one of the most significant regional policy issues. For areas designated as regions, the idea of development gives interesting perspectives of new possibilities and brings guarantee for better conditions of life to the society. The word: development, is strictly connected with the concept of constant economic growth. In the theory of regional policy, from the beginning of the industrial revolution in 18th century until the middle of 20th century, models of exogenous growth dominated. Those ideas were based on capital investment, consumption increase and expansion of big cities and industrial agglomerations. In the second half of last century, it turned out to be economically insufficient. The regional policy needed a new way of development. Scientists, business people and theoreticians of sociology and administration, began to search for a different and more effective method of regional growth. The answer for those efforts was models of endogenous growth. They are concentrated on: human capital, R&D, technical capital, self â government policy and ideas of citizens participation in the management. Those new ideas are opportunities for good prosperity, not only for well â developed areas, but also for poor â developed zones. Today, in the time of global economic stagnation, searching for new solutions in question of regional growth is strongly delimitated of those trends in regional development. They opened completely fresh notions and innovative dimensions in the surrounding world in which we exist.",M

Hence, this paper examines the effects of exchange rate fluctuation on tourism sector output in Nigeria for the period of 1995 to 2015, using the Vector Error Correction Model (VECM), granger causality test and co-integration approach to ascertain this relationship. Results revealed that exchange rate fluctuation indeed has a significantly negative effect on tourism sector output in Nigeria, and that an increased fluctuation reduces the contribution of the tourism sector to GDP. The granger Causality test result showed that there is a unidirectional causality and long run relationship between contribution of tourism sector to GDP and the contribution of the Tourism sector to employment, real effective exchange rate, and the international number of tourist arrival. Among various recommendations in the study is for the government of Nigeria to review existing economic policies that affect the exchange rate fluctuation, as these some of this policies may be responsible for the consistent increase in exchange rate fluctuation , as these could substantially reduce the number of tourist arrival and tourism sector output.",M

Therefore, electronic service quality (e-SQ) plays an important role for any business involved in online transaction to attract customers. Customers assessment of e-SQ is usually based on their actual experiences of interaction with the website. According to previous research, there exists relationship between e-SQ and service satisfaction. The moderating effect of technology acceptance model (TAM) shows positive result. As e-SQ and TAM improve, this will, in turn, improve service satisfaction. However, the relationship between e-SQ-TAM service satisfactions has been found to be not consistent in the case of low cost carrier airline in Malaysia. With concern to further understanding of this area, the present study explores dimensions of e-SQ in low cost carrier airline context and their relationship with service satisfaction. Furthermore, the moderating effect of perceived ease-of-use and perceived usefulness (TAM) was explored. This study employed convenience sampling and questionnaire method to gain data; 392 completed questionnaires were gathered from Malaysia Airline Industry (low cost carrier) website users. The result indicated that e-SQ dimensions: customization, site privacy and aesthetic, efficiency, system availability and fulfillment constitute e-SQ for low cost carrier airline.

"Maris Pukis","Local Dilemma about Liberalisation or Intervention","Public sector economics describes algorithms of public authoritiesâ decisions about liberalization of their tasks or intervention in the private issues. Such theory mainly concerns national or supra-national level decisions. Aim is to propose algorithm of similar decisions locally, taking into account individual specific of local situation. Methods of policy analysis for this aim are applied. Local governments have dual nature â they are executors of national policy as well as autonomous policy-makers and executors of own policy. General principles, formally recognized by all members of the Council of Europe (this concerns 100% of the EU countries) are: 1) for dividing of competences among national and local authorities â the principle of subsidiarity; 2) for scope and content of intervention â principle of proportionality. The same principles could be applied for decisions about liberalization or intervention of local issues, which concerns obligatory or voluntary local governmentsâ competences. Factors, which have to be taken into account to decide about intervention, are presence or absence of several types of local market failure and several types of government failure. Proposed algorithm of decision includes testing of sustainability of private activities, testing of main types of market failures, EU failure, national government failure, local government failure. That first cycle of procedure is practical implementation of the principle of subsidiarity. If intervention is necessary, then there are several options, how to impact on situation. The choice could be done among 1) regulation of private activities with corresponding administration; 2) supplying of public services for free; 3) supplying services or goods for partial payments of beneficiaries; 4) direct entrepreneurship; 5) facilitating private entrepreneurs or organized civil society organizations; 6) outsourcing of corresponding local government activities. That second cycle of procedure is practical implementation of the principle of proportionality to ensure as minimal intervention, as possible.",M

Correct use of digital printing and binding equipment effectively addresses the economics of this process as well. A process of storing the books is ignored as the number of printed copies is directly related to the number of orders. Publishing house owning the printed version of PDF publication chooses the file from the database and sends it to the printing company with the on-demand printer. This process is highly efficient for printing companies and also for bookstores as well. Bookstores should be no exception in being Print-on-demand printer owners.",M

Specifically, this research study demonstrates that the consumer demographic characteristic of age does make a difference in the COO influence for product categories within Morocco. Age was shown to interact with the impact of COO with regard to purchasing decisions regarding products from more industrialized/economically advanced nations, compared to products from less  economically  advanced/industrialized nations. These results have managerial implications in assisting multinational organizations in their market segmentations and positioning strategies.",M

Dando respuesta a las demandas de formación de la sociedad y teniendo en cuenta las características de los medios y capacidades disponibles (inputs difícilmente transformables y sustitutivos), es de esperar que las universidades hayan definido dicha oferta con el fin de obtener ventajas competitivas. Algunos estudios señalan que las instituciones de educación superior tienen una tendencia innata a diferenciarse incrementando su diversidad (Parsons y Platt, 1973; Clark, 1983), ofreciendo un rango de disciplinas mayor (Texeira et al., 2012). Otros estudios, inspirados en la teoría del isomorfismo institucional (DiMaggio and Powell, 1991), han llegado a la conclusión opuesta: a causa de la influencia homogeneizadora del contexto institucional existe menos diversidad (Goedegebuure et al., 1996; Huisman y Morphew, 1998; Neave, 2000 y van Vught, 1996 y 2008). Entonces las universidades especializan su oferta en títulos de un determinado campo científico (Aldrich, 1979; Rossi, 2010 y Texeira et al,. 2012), imitan la oferta realizada por los competidores más exitosos (Goedegebuure et al., 1996) o se concentran en las disciplinas más populares. A partir de los grados ofrecidos por los centros universitarios presenciales españoles antes y después de la adaptación al EEES, analizamos qué estrategias de diversificación han seguido al diseñar su oferta de estudios de grado y los procesos de diferenciación resultantes. En segundo lugar se analiza la influencia de determinados factores (tamaño de la institución, nivel de competencia en el mercado, aceptación de los estudios, satisfacción de la demanda y antigüedad del centro) en la adopción de una estrategia determinada de diversificación y en la diferenciación resultante.",I

Such incommensurable attrition poses huge social and economic costs, given the inverse relationship between education and factors like poverty, inequality, violence, health issues, and mortality. Therefore, understanding this phenomenon and its determinants, and effectively reducing attrition rates should be a priority in government and universities agendas. Both for socially responsible and for strategic reasons, higher education institutions should strive to improve retention rates and increase students likelihood of successfully graduating from their programs. Based on our firsthand experience in a private business school in Colombia, we estimate the effect of the Student Follow-up and Retention Program using a regression discontinuity and difference-in- differences empirical strategies, that will help improve retention and increase students likelihood of successfully graduating.",I

The main objective of this research is to identify effective teachers based on their teaching practices and efficient use of their available resources. It is common in the effectiveness literature to rely on the achievement of teachers students to measure the effectiveness of a particular teacher. Nevertheless, we propose the capacity of teachers to engage students in their lessons as an alternative to students achievement, as it may be reflecting their ability to raise students learning interest and, thus, denoting their effectiveness. In order to indentify these teachers, we focus on fourth grade reading and mathematics teachers in Spain using TIMSS and PIRLS 2011 data and we propose a two step procedure whose first step consists of obtaining a measure of teachers efficiency using their available educational resources to explain their students achievement. Then, the latter is employed in a second step together with teachers practices in the classroom to explain students engagement in lessons. The relevance of this research is rooted on the determination of the characteristics, teaching procedures and efficient use of resources which can make a teacher effective. To the extent that these effective teachers are able to improve their students engagement thanks to their effective methods and independently of their students socio-economic background, they would be fostering the improvement of social mobility and education systems, and hence the socio-cultural development of the Spanish society.",I

The present work goes a step further by making a distinction between three different dimensions of maturity: students mental age, proxied by the time when children began to exhibit the basic competences (reading and writing); chronological age, represented by the bimester of birth; and grade repetition, which represents a maturity related to academic knowledge. The suitability of the quarter of birth and the ages of beginning to read and write as an instrument of repetition has been checked, finding that they are not adequate for this purpose This finding might be reinforcing the argument that the ages of beginning to read and write, the quarter of birth and grade repetition might be measuring different dimensions of students maturity.",I

All the studies agree on the key factors that explain this progress, including the commitment to specialized training designed to guarantee the competitivess of its companies on an international level, in particular in the technology, chemical/pharmaceutical and food and agricultural sectors. Given the limitations of its domestic market, all entrepreneurial initiatives linked to these areas have targeted export markets, and these efforts have received government support and been reinforced by a close collaboration between universities and the business world. Within this context, business schools have played a crucial role given their close ties to business, not only as far as supplying skilled labour, but also by providing business advice as well as a space that serves as a meeting point for entrepreneurs. This situation has fostered the development of a modern, dynamic and, above all, enterprising entrepreneurial culture. The close links between Ireland and Galicia are due to geographical, historical and cultural factors; however, this is not the case in terms of their evolution over the last few decades. This paper aims to contribute to a better understanding of the Celtic Tiger miracle through a study of Irish business schools that analyses their efficiency and compares this to that of their counterparts in Galicia during the 1997-2002 period in order to determine if, as in the case of their economies, there are any significant competitive differences.",I

To do so, each country has implemented different strategies, leading to very different forms of education provision. While Finnish emphasise on high trained and empowered teachers, student early intervention and weekly (multidisciplinary) team teachers meetings, Koreans encourage student hard work (in and out of school) and active learning by integrating ICTs in their daily learning (digital textbooks and cyber-home) which is complemented with parent support/interest. These two ways of providing education clearly raises the question of the role played by human resources and/or technology in education provision. To do so, we use each countries individual sample of the PISA-2012 database at student and school levels, and given the nested nature of the data, we employ multilevel models. Estimations have been made from a comparative approach, in a case-to-case basis. Results suggest that human resources and technology influence student outcomes in both cases. Yet, for both countries a common set of technologies influence the overall set of outcomes.",I

The United States and other countries enforce these laws within the terms of the World Trade Organization (WTO). There is a difference between U.S. enforcement and the enforcement approach of other countries, however. The United States­but not other countries of which I am aware--now uses 'zeroing' in its determination of whether imports are dumped. The use of 'zeroing' will almost always increase the level of any antidumping duty, and will sometimes create a duty where none would have been imposed, had the methodology not been used.",F

This paper presents a three-generation migrant analysis, comparing relative economic performance of various migrant generations to one another and to the native population. We developed a theoretical model, which was then explored empirically using data from the 1995 Israeli Census. In both the theoretical and empirical analyses, the curve describing intergenerational immigrant earnings mobility is inversely U-shaped. The second generation earns relatively more than the first and third generations, while the third generation earns less than the second, but more than the first. Thus, assimilation of the third generation into the local population is far from clear.",F

When analyzing the reasons of audit failures scholars point at the lack of independence of auditors, who act against professional ethics and issue opinions which are in line with the expectations of the clients. Psychological studies suggest however, that the main reasons of audit failures are not negligence or conscious corruption, but cognitive biases. The article presents the main cognitive limitations which affect judgment and decision-making process of auditors: heuristics (availability, representativeness and anchoring), overconfidence, escalation of commitment and motivated reasoning. We present structural characteristics which make the auditing industry prone to cognitive biases. We also discuss possible measures aimed at reducing the number of audit failures.",M

The article starts with the presentation of the oldest approaches towards internationalisation and shows how ongoing changes in the global economic environment have influenced international behaviours of firms as well as changed the  researchers  perception  of  BGs  and  their  internationalisation  process.  The  article  highlights  the role  of  knowledge  in  BGs  internationalisation.  Due  to  the  magnitude  of  literature  on  BGs  and  their internationalisation, this article does not cover all of them. The article ends with conclusions and points to  further  opportunities  and  directions  of  research.  This  article  came  into  being  within  the  research project OPUS entitled: Patterns of internationalization of high-tech small and medium-sized enterprises, (UMO-2013/11/B/HS4/02135) 2014-2017.",F

The main  objective  of  the  article  is  to  verify  whether  geographic  distance  to  the  border  (localisation  of the  firm)  has  an  impact  or  effect  on  the  internationalisation  process.  The  V4  research  survey  results and  the  sample  of  190  internationalised  Polish  businesses  were  used  in  order  to  meet  the  objective and  verify  the  assumed  hypothesis.  The  results  of  the  Mann-Withney  test,  Students  t  test  as  well  as ANOVA  analysis  prove  that  businesses  operating  in  bordering  regions  are  more  internationalised  than these  operating  in  inner  regions  of  Poland.  Consequently,  the  research  hypothesis  was  confirmed  and all  in  all  it  is  obvious  from  the  foregoing  evidence  that  the  businesses  localised  in  bordering  regions are more internationalised than the firms localised in inner regions not having borders with neighbouring countries.

"Mariola Ciszewska-Mlinaric","Global Mindset and Internationalization of Polish SMEs: Antecedents and Outcomes (Mentalnosc globalna a umiedzynarodowienie malych i srednich polskich firm)","The  concept  of  global  mindset  has  recently  received  significant  attention  in  the  fields  of  international business and international entrepreneurship. A strong relationship between the global mindset and firms internationalization behavior has also been found in the context of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs); however, in the context of Polish research, the phenomenon has not been examined in depth. Thus, the purpose of this article is to broaden our understanding of antecedents of the global mindset and its significance for internationalization outcomes (performance and behavior) of small and medium-sized Polish firms operating in a low-tech but fairly internationalized sector. The study findings indicate that the global mindset is a key capability relevant for explaining the international performance of SMEs, but its impact on firms international behavior is somewhat equivocal. Moreover, often employed individual-level predictors of the global mindset are statistically insignificant, as is length of firm international experience. The paper concludes with a discussion of the implications and limitations of the findings",F

This is a consequence of the specific nature of luxury goods, but most of all the different needs and behavior of consumers of these goods.

An interesting issue seems to be due to the reaction of Polish consumers of luxury goods to the crisis. Taking into account the specificity of a luxury product, marketing tools supporting its existence on the market and the buyers behavior, consumers response to the crisis may be unexpected. Condition of the Polish market of luxury certainly is surprising.

Nevertheless, not every entrepreneur exercises innovation and not every innovation leads to entrepreneurship. University Business Incubators (UBIs) have been considered as the main factor for entrepreneurial process in which if innovation takes place, the perspective of economic success becomes wide open. Currently, UBIs are typified and considered around the world as guides in the process of entrepreneurship; one of their objectives is the creation of startups that can eventually consolidate in the market. The aim of this work is to identify by means of the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) the priority of UBIs performance criteria on the basis of the main levels of impacts the litera- ture remarks on: a) economic action, b) National Development Plan and/or c) scientific action. These criteria are related with four characteristic UBIs functions: i) provision of means of production, ii) strengthening entrepreneurship culture, iii) bonding with the mar- ket to generate a base of future firms, and, iv) creating pull effect. The hypothesis of this work is that UBIs classification not only allows for identifying their main characteristics but it also points toward a normative application of criteria and alternatives of performance, in order to reach the objective of creating and fostering solid and stable enterprises, no matter the sponsoring university characteristics. We tested it by analyzing the three most important Mexican UBIs. The results show that although the analyzed UBIs are a specific type of business incubators, their criteria and alternatives of performance differ among them.",M

However, none of these offer an opinion about qualitative aspects of organizational management, especially risk management. Therefore, it is necessary to redefine internal auditing and to determine the new scopes for it in order to ensure from adoption of modern risk management tools, adequ- acy and effectiveness of these tools and also helping organizational units to reduce risks. These changes in focus and attention of internal auditing are possible by revision in attitudes to audit and changing it to risk-based internal auditing. Regarding this matter, the main purpose of this study is to provide a?comprehensive and practical model for implementing and using risk-based internal auditing in companies and organizations. This model is designed based on theoretical principles presented in the literature and relevant research as well as professional experience of the authors. Also, the designed model has been implemented in one of the large Iranian organizations, which increases the value and applicability of the model.",M

Nevertheless, the empirical evidence for economic effectiveness of prevention in real-world settings is scarce. We analyze costs and effectiveness of a specific type 2 diabetes prevention program in Finland, the GOAL Lifestyle Implementation Trial (GOAL LIT). We developed a Markov model with five mutually exclusive (disease) states and discrete one-year intervals to simulate the health effects of the intervention over 15 years. Based on the 3-year follow-up results from the intervention and a risk factor matched control group, we computed annual transition probabilities between BMI levels. The mortality differences between intervention and control group after 15 years are insignificant for both sexes. Projected cumulative costs of diabetes for both sexes are significantly lower in the intervention group compared to control group. From the perspective of the health care system the cost saving of the study depends on the assumed degree of complications with type 2 diabetes. For an all-male intervention group, the net benefit is positive above the threshold of 8 per cent average annual complication rate. The average overall monetary gain of the intervention then lies between â¬213.8 and â¬354.8 per person. The GOAL LIT would also be cost-effective, if the program was conducted in a representative Finnish population, with possible costs savings following the intervention between â¬64.8 and â¬155.8 per person. The results indicate that a diabetes prevention program like the GOAL LIT can be cost effective. Potential cost effects are mainly due to male participants, but nevertheless also notable in a representative population. However, our framework only focuses on one obesity related disease and thus tends to underestimate the cost savings as well as potential mortality benefits.",I

En la actualidad, sus niveles de vida son muy diversos. España pasó de un sistema autárquico en la década de los 40 sin recibir ayuda externa a un sistema abierto al comercio y la integración económica en los ochenta. Fue excluida del Plan Marshall, pero recibió ayuda americana y doce préstamos del Banco Mundial entre 1963-1977. El artículo detalla la cuantía y naturaleza de esta ayuda y muestra lecciones para la actual gestión de la ayuda al desarrollo en torno a la apropiación, la institucionalidad y la condicionalidad. También hace una comparación retrospectiva con Chile, Costa Rica y Nicaragua. Mientras España ha crecido entre 1959-1990 al 4%, Chile y Costa Rica lo hacen al 1.3% y Nicaragua al 0.4%, siendo éste país el que más AOD ha recibido. España muestra que recibir gran cantidad de AOD no es suficiente para salir de la pobreza, pero mientras que su ausencia la hizo perder bienestar en un 8% PIB, la ayuda recibida por el Banco Mundial la ayudó a multiplicar su renta per capita por 8,5%.",F

Además, la creación del Espacio Europeo de Educación Superior ha incrementado la relevancia de la evaluación de la calidad científica. Sin embargo, la falta de transparencia sobre los procedimientos de obtención supone que muchas de estas clasificaciones sean difíciles de interpretar y, por ello, se hace necesario utilizar métodos que garanticen la fiabilidad, validez y utilidad de las ordenaciones establecidas. En concreto, que sean objetivos en la selección de los criterios, en la asignación de pesos a los indicadores y establezcan de forma precisa la unidimensionalidad ó multidimensionalidad de los rankings. El objetivo del trabajo es proponer métodos de obtención de rankings que posean las deseables propiedades. Se presentan dos métodos. El primero, basado en los modelos DEA y el segundo se construye sobre indicadores ratio. Los procedimientos producen rankings que no dependen de la especificación del modelo aplicado, establecen criterios objetivos de ponderación en la definición de los indicadores globales y obtienen ordenaciones según determinadas orientaciones productivas.  Los métodos se aplican a una muestra de 47 universidades públicas españolas, con datos referidos al año 2008.

Using PISA data 2003 for Germany we examine the validity of cultural reproduction and cultural mobility theories in the case of immigrant students. We show that the education of parents has a higher positive impact on the student performance only in the case of German students. Parental education has no effect on school achievement of immigrants, unless the mother has a low level of education.

In this paper we analyze the effectiveness of the Structural Funds in Objective 1 regions during the programming period, 2000-2006. Firstly, the EU expenditure is divided into seven categories, with the aim to identify which of them show a positive and real contribution to growth. Secondly, we test the existence of a national influence on the regional capability to take advantage from Structural Funds. Finally, we show how this country effect is related to the quality of governance of each country.",R

The model is estimated using the Fully Modified Ordinary Least Squares approach, which corrects for endogeneity of data and serial correlation. The results of the estimated regression are in tune with the economic theory.

That is, fiscal convergence (in the form of persistently similar ratios of government surplus/deficit to GDP) is systematically associated with more synchronized business cycles. We also find evidence that reduced fiscal deficits increase business cycle synchronization. The Maastricht convergence criteria, used to determine eligibility for EMU, encouraged fiscal convergence and deficit reduction.

"Zsolt Darvas","Real Effective Exchange Rates for 178 Countries: a New Database","We use data on exchange rates and consumer price indices and the weighting matrix derived by Bayoumi, Lee and Jaewoo (2006) to calculate consumer price index-based REER. The main novelties of our database are that (1) it includes data for 178 countries many more than in any other publicly available database plus an external REER for the euro area, using a consistent methodology; (2) it includes up-to-date REER values, such as data for January 2012; and (3) it is relatively easy to calculate REER against any arbitrary group of countries. The annual database is complete for 172 countries and the euro area for 1992-2011 and data is available for six other countries for a shorter period. For several countries annual data is available for earlier years as well, e.g. data is available for 67 countries from 1960. The monthly database is complete for 138 countries for January 1995-January 2012, and data is also available for 15 other countries for a shorter period. The indicators calculated by us are freely downloadable and will be irregularly updated.",F
"Neubauer, Sarah|Zeidler, Jan|Lange, Ansgar|Graf von der Schulenburg, J.-Matthias","Grundlagen und Methoden von GKV-Routinedatenstudien","Claims data studies are becoming an increasingly important source of information for healthcare stakeholders. The importance and scientific use of claims data of the statutory health funds has further increased. We saw a general lack of elaborated recommendations for best practices in this field and a need for a thorough overview of published methods used in each step of conducting a claims data study. This discussion paper examines and compares conceptual and methodological approaches used in claims data studies aiming to stimulate discussion on quality of the studies and to promote creation of standards and guidelines for consistent and transparent claims data studies and reports. Our results emphasize the importance guidelines in the field of claims data analyses and discussed the advantages and disadvantages of different methodological approaches.",I

Factors which prove to be closely related to regime switches are short term interest rate, inflation differentials and differences in economic growth. There-fore fundamentals do not only matter for the exchange rate within each regime, but are also related to the switches between the regimes.",F

A reading of the large literature on this topic allows us to establish a set of stylised facts, including the facts that technical analysis is an important and widely used method of analysis in the foreign exchange market and that applying certain technical trading rules over a sustained period may lead to significant positive excess returns. We then analyze four arguments that have been put forward to explain the continuing widespread use of technical analysis and its apparent profitability: that the foreign exchange market may be characterised by not-fully-rational behaviour; that technical analysis may exploit the influence of central bank interventions; that technical analysis may be an efficient form of information processing; and finally that it may provide information on non-fundamental influences on foreign exchange movements. Although all of these positions may be relevant to some degree, neither non-rationality nor official interventions seem to be widespread and persistent enough to explain the obstinate passion of foreign exchange professionals for technical analysis.",F

Waiting calls from the front-office queue flow over to the back office, if a waiting-time limit is reached and at least one back-office agent is available. The analysis of such a system with time-dependent overflow is reduced to the analysis of a continuous-time Markov chain with state-dependent overflow probabilities. To approximate the system with time-dependent overflow, some waiting-based performance measures are modified. Numerical results demonstrate the reliability of this Markovian performance approximation for different parameter settings. A sensitivity analysis shows the impact of the waiting-time limit and the dependence of the performance measures on the arrival rate.",M

Most important seems to be the acknowledgment that the IMF in its current form lacks legitimacy and ownership. Accordingly, the G20 suggests a reallocation of voting shares to emerging and developing countries, an antedated reform of the quota system, a delinking of the managing director's election from regional origin and support for the Singapore quota and voice reform of 2006. Unfortunately, these reform decisions remain in part imprecise, they leave crucial issues untouched and they are not implemented, not even by several G20 countries themselves. So the intended reform takes the right direction but it must be implemented soon before any progress can be stated.",F

A French Case Explanatory Analysis","This paper investigates to what extent IFRS standards may cause incentives or constraints on long-term investment strategies of French insurance companies, based on 43 semi-structured interviews of insurance companies managers, regulators and professional organizations in France. Our results show that practitioners highlight some issues related to the capacity of current IFRS accounting rules to give a fair representation of their activities related to their specific profile. First, they underline an artificial mismatch between assets and liabilities measurement related to IAS 39 and IFRS 4 phase 1. Second, they point out effects on their asset allocation strategies due to the increased short-term volatility introduced by fair value measurement. After investigating solutions to recognising the long-term horizon in asset category, we discuss the necessary consistency of accounting standard for representing long-term business.",M
"Elias Oikarinen","Empirical application of the housing-market no-arbitrage condition: problems, solutions and a Finnish case study","The often used housing price-to-income and housing price-to-rent ratios are problematic in housing market analysis and may result in misleading conclusions. Instead, the no-arbitrage condition of housing market is a theoretically sound basis to evaluate if housing prices are misaligned. Unfortunately, empirical applica-tion of the no-arbitrage condition has notable complications. This article reviews these complications and suggests some solutions to them. The use of implied expected appreciation derived from the no-arbitrage condition is recommended. It is also claimed that the real appreciation is better to use than the nominal one in the no-arbitrage computations. Furthermore, the paper shows that the maintenance costs as a fraction of housing price vary substantially in time and location, which may significantly affect the equilibrium housing price level relative to rental prices. An empirical application of the no-arbitrage relation using data from ten Finnish cities shows that housing price level in 2007 was not based on high expected appreciation. This lowers the fears for a price bubble.",R

Tito","Patterns of trade and oligopoly equilibria: an example","In this paper we investigate, via an example, the effects of oligopolistic competition in a two countries two goods Ricardian model of international trade. By contrast with results that apply to the competitive free trade equilibrium, at the oligopoly equilibrium industries with different technologies can profitably survive. Moreover we show that, in an oligopolistic setting, the pattern of trade cannot be inferred neither by pre-trade prices, nor by the comparative advantage principle.",F

It is then natural, if the location of families in the city follows a socially stratified pattern, to observe differences in public school's performances even when they are identically financed. Free school choice is not enough to change this outcome. Capacity cannot be changed overnight and schools facing an excess demand may be forced to turn applications down. If the aim of the schoolis to maximize expected achievement of children, those from a less favored environment will be rejected first and segregation will increase. In order to overcome this negative result we propose a system of grants to disadvantaged children as a means to finance public schools.",I

and the mixture of distribution hypothesis","This paper sheds new light on the mixture of distribution hypothesis by means of a study of the weekly exchange rate volatility of the Norwegian krone. In line with other studies we find that the impact of information arrival on exchange rate volatility is positive and statistically significant, and that the hypothesis that an increase in the number of traders reduces exchange rate volatility is not supported. The novelties of our study consist in documenting that the positive impact of information arrival on volatility is relatively stable across three different exchange rate regimes, and in that the impact is relatively similar for both weekly volatility and weekly realised volatility. It is not given that the former should be the case since exchange rate stabilisation was actively pursued by the central bank in parts of the study period. We also report a case in which undesirable residual properties attained within traditional frameworks are easily removed by applying the log-transformation on volatilities.",F

Such interferences lead to the Mortality Paradox: the worse the survival conditions of the poor are, the lower the measured poverty is. We examine several solutions to avoid that paradox. We identify conditions under which the extension, by means of a fictitious income, of lifetime income profiles of the prematurely dead neutralizes the noise due to differential mortality. Then, to account not only for the missing poor, but, also, for the hidden poverty (premature death), we use, as a fictitious income, the welfare-neutral income, making indifferent between life continuation and death. The robustness of poverty measures to the extension technique is illustrated with regional Belgian data.",I

The optimal insurance contract takes the form of a system of implicit deductibles, i.e. it results in the same indemnities as a contract with full insurance above a variable deductible positively related to the elasticity of medical expenditures with respect to the insurance rate. In a model with an explicit stop-loss arrangement, i.e. with a predefined ceiling on the annual expenses of the insured, this stop-loss takes the form of a deductible, i.e. there is no reimbursement for expenses below the stop-loss amount. One motivation to have some insurance below the deductible arises if regular health care expenditures in a situation of standard health have a negative effect on the probability of getting into a state with large medical expenses.",I

We show that the extent to which FGT measures (Foster Greer Thorbecke 1984) underestimate old-age poverty under income-differentiated mortality depends on whether the prematurely dead would have, in case of survival, suffered from a more severe poverty than the average surviving population. Taking adjusted FGT measures with ex- tended lifetime income profiles as a benchmark, we identify conditions under which the selection bias induced by income-differentiated mortality is higher for distribution-sensitive measures than for headcount measures. Finally, we show, on the basis of data on poverty in 11 European economies, that the size of the selection bias varies across different sub-classes of FGT measures and across countries.",I

Inter-generational Implications of the Vietnam-Era Lottery","It is evident that a strong positive correlation persists between the educational attainment of parents and that of their children in many, if not most, populations. This relationship may form an important part of the phenomenon of low social mobility as well as inefficiently low investment in human capital by youth who have parents with relatively low educational attainment. Is it a genetic inter-generational transmission of innate ability from parents to their children (i.e. nature) or is it the environment that the better educated parents provide for their children (i.e. nurture) that explains this positive relationship? Understanding the relative contributions of nature versus nurture is critical to the development of any social policy designed to increase social and economic mobility between generations. Separating the so-called nature and nurture effects of this relationship is a difficult task. We use the Vietnam Era Draft Lottery as a natural experiment to address the nature-nurture question. Attending university in order to avoid the draft created a cohort which included individuals who would not normally have attended post-secondary educational institutions. Comparing the educational attainment of children of this cohort to that of cohorts who attended university in ânormal timesâ creates a natural experiment to test the relative importance of the nature or nurture explanations. Our findings provide evidence in support of the nurture argument.",I

It also briefly discusses the usefulness of teaching computer literacy in schools. While access to computers is a necessary condition for their use, access does not guarantee that students will use the computers, and getting students to use computers does not guarantee that they will use them in ways that improve their cognitive achievement. When students do use computers in school it is generally to search the Internet, work on group projects, or to use the Internet to do homework. Research shows that programs that increase the number of computers in schools have had little effect on studentsâ test scores. However, a growing body of research does suggest that when computers are used to provide instruction test scores in reading and math increase. This kind of computer instruction is not very common in most countries and even in the United States computer instruction is rarely routinely used in schools.",I

Profit-maximizing oligopolists are vertically disintegrated and produce for both markets and the fair trade firm can charge a premium to consumers due to a warm glow effect that depends on the wage paid to fair trade producers. We show that trade integration will unambiguously increase the size of the fair trade firm. However, the relative size compared to oligopolists shrinks with integration. The effect of a change in substitutability between the two commodities on markets shares depends on the relative market potential. Furthermore, we show that the warm glow effect does not support an expansion of the volume of fair trade.",F

Hence, a new approach seems necessary, respectively the one of relative advantages that are related to economies of scale and marketability, as today, the macroeconomic concept is the concept of Multinational or Transnational, and no longer a national one. At the same time, the micro-concept may be used as concept of an entire international economic sector or branch.

Promoting sustainable development presupposes correlating economic growth with improving the quality of life and health, education, social development and environmental protection. The issue of sustainable development as a complex phenomenon is approached under the conditions of the influence exerted by some constraints and restrictions, of the existence of some serious economic, social and technological gaps in regional and European context. The analysis of the external commercial flows of goods highlights the predominance in exports of products from the traditional economic sectors. Improving competitiveness of export is regarded as the decisive factor of sustainable economic growth. For the chapter regarding the reform of the investment climate, modest successes are recorded which did not give the necessary impetus to massive foreign capital entries under the form of foreign direct investments as compared with other Central and Eastern European countries. The low attractiveness for foreign direct investments is attenuated by the small size of the local market and the low purchasing power of the population. Ensuring economic sustainable development is approached within the context of creating the necessary premises and valuing the opportunities provided by the protects for European integration of the Republic of Moldova.",F

"Iuliana PANTELIMON","Statistical analysis the development of breast cancer; influencing factors","The incidence of breast cancer in Romania is about 66.2/100,000 and the mortality around 22.1/100,000. The European Association for the Study of Obesity shows that the prevalence of the obesity is 10-25% for men and 10-30% for women. Data from literature sustain that the costs linked with breast cancer management are about 126 billion euro in 2009, 40% representing medical costs. Increasing of the survival and the prolongation of the time to progression is very important because it means there is a significant decrease inthe cost linked to: oncological medication, the hospitalization days, diagnosis investigation and also a prolongation of the time in wich the patient is integrated socio-economically and also in the family. An important indicator in this disease would be the years of potential life lost.. Material and methods: in this paper, we followed the evolution of 50 patients treated between January 2009 and December 2014 within Elias University Emergency Hospital. The above mentioned patients were monitored from diagnosis until the first imagistic documented progression. Several parameters were monitored, amongst which the body mass index, time to progression, age distribution, Ki 67 proliferation index and also the correlation between the parameters. Results: The body mass of the majority of the patients (22) was between 30 and 35 kg/m2, thus being considered obese. The average value of the time to progression for the monitored patients was 40,98 months, in concordance with the values found in literature. One particular aspect of the monitored patients was the high frequency of breast cancer within the group of patients under age of 50, followed by 45-50 group and the last was the 35-45 group. Conclusions: The excess of adipose tissue could represent a negative prognostic factor in the breast cancer progression. One important aspect is that this prognostic factor could be influenced by creating policies aimed at weight losing and healthy life-style. Breast cancer occurs predominantly with women within the 4-5 age decade, thus, the mortality and the morbidity generated by it determines the loss of many potential life years and a social-economic exclusion of the respective women.",I

EU undergoes an identity crisis with multiple facets: geographical, socio-economic, moral, ideologic, and strategic ones, etc. The main goal of EU for the last three decades is no longer population welfare, but competitiveness , and the chief means of increasing it is production costs diminution that occurs by massive layoffs and wage decreases. EU enlargement and in-depth processes have created new issues such as enterprises relocalisation, immigration, social protection system, and foregoing the chance to dominate the world. The second part analyses the consequences related to the turmoil within EU: co-existence of welfare and poverty (increased unemployment, growth of discrepancies between countries); massive absence at the latest polls; lack of confidence in political personalities; risks of enlargement without previous operated in-depth changes, etc. Despite its flagrant shortcommings it is less probable that the EU would dissolve. It amassed a lot of red-tape (bureaucracy) and embodied so many interests, so that the most likely development seems to be an even greater enlargement, until it will become completely ineffective.

"Sharma, Rishi","Optimal Tariffs with Inframarginal Exporters","This paper shows that the presence of inframarginal exporters can itself be a reason for a positive optimal tariff. To demonstrate this, I develop a new model of international trade that incorporates fixed costs of exporting and firm heterogeneity within a perfectly competitive framework. In this setting, despite the fact that there are no pre-existing distortions, even a small importing country with no world market power has an incentive to optimally impose a tariff. In the limit, as either firm heterogeneity or the fixed costs of exporting vanish â so that there are no inframarginal firms â the optimal tariff approaches zero. The importing country is able to benefit from a tariff because part of the burden falls on the exporter rents earned by foreign inframarginal firms.",F

The future competitiveness of the Malaysian economy depends heavily on the knowledge-based characteristics where entrepreneurial aspects are considered more important for future economic growth and the alleviation of poverty. In support for the entrepreneurial activities among the poor, microfinance1 program is deemed important for the poor to start their business activities in the form of microenterprises. The integration of entrepreneurial concept and microenterprise into microfinance program also contributes towards increasing the effectiveness of the program. Basically, the microfinance program in Malaysia has been administered by various institutions and non-banking government agencies. The most important institutions for this study are Lembaga Zakat Selangor (LZS), Yayasan Basmi Kemiskinan (YBK) Selangor, Amanah Ikhtiar Malaysia (AIM) and Yayasan Tekun Nasional (TEKUN). However, it is doubtful whether this program has achieved its objective in enhancing the socio-economic level of the poor and contributing to the development of entrepreneurial activities. In addition, there have been very few studies to evaluate the importance of monitoring in enhancing the effectiveness of the microfinance program. Therefore, the focus of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of YBK Selangor, AIM, TEKUN and LZS microfinance programs in increasing the participants business income by conducting microenterprise businesses through the adoption of entrepreneurial concept. Based on the univariate and multivariate analyses, the results show that AIM is the most effective microfinance program as it enables the poor to increase their business income and contributes to the development of entrepreneurial activities. Results of the study also show that monitoring, fund size, purpose of loan usage and total income before participating in the microfinance program, are the main factors which influence the level of income that poor people can generate.  In addition, Islamic microfinance program which is based on Syariah and Islamic Finance concept has a very high potential in helping the poor to expand and diversify their economic activities, and increase their contribution towards development of entrepreneurial activities",M

Research and conceptualizations which suggest that small businesses are key for economic growth and development may not be sufficient in fully explaining the construct. The research expounds a variety of concepts that attempt to put the millennium framework for managing entrepreneurship in perspective. Research has shown that Africa has more than 40% of the worlds natural resources yet ranks the poorest on economic and social indicators. Developing economies like China, India and Malaysia have grown rapidly, while Latin America has also experienced moderate growth due to their entrepreneurship thrust. By contrast much of developing economies in Africa have stagnated and even regressed in terms of foreign trade, investment, per capita income and other economic growth measures. According to Peter Drucker (1997) there is no such thing as resource until man finds a use and thus endows it with economic value. Until then, every plant is a weed and every mineral just another rock.   According to African Development Bank (2002), Africa is the least industrialized continent; only South Africa, Egypt, Morocco and Tunisia have significant manufacturing sectors. This therefore means that all of the continents natural resources are exported for secondary refining and manufacturing. There is no such thing as a resource until the entrepreneur finds a use for something in nature and thus endows it with economic value. The report represented here sets out a sustainable millennium framework for managing entrepreneurship in developing countries and work as catalysts towards attaining macroeconomic objectives particularly as they relate to balance of payments, economic growth and employment creation",M

Estimation result suggests that lack of proficiency in English, a mismatch between the type of graduation degree and the requirements for the available jobs in the labor market, family background, state of happiness in overall life, self-expectation on ones employability and some socio-demographic characteristics (such as ethnicity) are significant determinants of graduate unemployment duration in Malaysia. Specifically, the hypothesis of selection in literature of happiness studies is supported; non-English languages proficiency (including Chinese) has no significant impact; and it is imperative to have a realistic self-expectation on ones employability.",M

The emergence of the internet as a tool in the ecommerce for the transactions between businesses to consumer (B2C) has far outcomes. The dominant advantage is that created an opportunity for business to have a direct contact with consumers and make electronic markets. The widely increasing of these activities in cyberspace and virtual communities on the internet, offline and online disputes are rising. The cost of litigation for resolving these disputes is prohibitive, the fighting and acrimony inherent in the process destroys relationships that otherwise could be preserved, and the inadequacy of current private international law, the lack of specialization, the complexity of litigation causes major delays. ADR (alternative dispute resolution) is a better way for the resolution of e-commerce disputes. ADR is a settling dispute outside of the courtroom and trained, impartial persons decide disputes or help parties decide disputes themselves. You often have more time and flexibility to fully explain your side of the case using ADR than you would in court. Moreover, the two factors of dispute resolution and information technology have combined into a new system, which is more effective, more flexible and less costly compare to traditional approaches. The tool is called online dispute resolution (ODR). The study analysis ADR and ODR mechanisms for conflict resolution of ecommerce especially in B2C disputes.",M

Specifically, we predicted the positive contribution of workplace spirituality to affective commitment. A sample of 153 auditors was drawn from big four public accounting firms in the northern region of Malaysia. Simple random sampling was used in this study. A multiple regression analysis had been carried out and the result had shown that the teams sense of community, sense of contribution to the society and enjoyment at work have had the major influences to the organizational affective commitment. The findings help the employers to realize the importance of the three aspects of workplace spirituality and consequently, have encouraged the employers to instill this sense of workplace spirituality in order to enhance their employees affective commitment. This, in turn will ultimately increase the positive outcomes such as honesty, creativity, trust and commitment and further improve the organizational performance and long term organizational success.",M

Several individual factors have been considered as predictive variables of whistle-blowing intention. However, findings are still inconclusive. Using the theory of planned behaviour as a framework, this study examines the relationship between the selected predictive variables (internal locus of control, work experience and ethics training) and whistle-blowing intention. Data were collected randomly from 311 supervisors within large manufacturing companies in Malaysia.

However, determining proper management practice require an understanding of the attitudes of those involved. This paper examines the Sri Lankan context of community tourism initiatives that is integrated with participatory natural resource management programmes. Focusing on participation readiness of the community in terms of their attitudes towards tourism development, their commitment, and the existing community capacity, the study employs a mixed method with predominantly qualitative approach to obtain data and analyze two communities of similar nature. It critically evaluates the efforts of community empowerment programmes delivered by the state institutions and non-governmental organizations in the selected areas. It also discusses of repercussions of generic issues in existing policy and legislation of the country that can have significant bearing on community empowerment efforts as well. The findings reveal that in the study context, the community capacity and community commitment factors are very subjective and can affect the success of community participation considerably despite the communitys positive attitudes towards tourism development. Thus, empowering local communities to become self-reliant in tourism, and helping them to raise incomes and improve their standards of living has become a key challenge in this context. The findings draw attention on the pressing need for understanding inherent weaknesses of rural communities and external factors affecting the success of these initiatives. The implication is the need for change in technicalities in the present approach of community tourism development  one that provide policies that recognize, and facilitate communitys participation in tourism development",M

It includes understanding target markets that could provide desired return to the organization, but are difficult to access. In the contexts of museums in Malaysia, this potentially lucrative but reluctant market is the youth market. This study looks at 1. The motivations of young adults for visiting museums, 2. The reasons inhibiting them from visiting museums, and 3. Their perceptions on how museums should be marketed to attract young adults. Using a questionnaire survey, 1036 usable questionnaires were analyzed to fulfill the research objectives. The findings indicate that youth within the study context has higher predisposition to visit museums and could be a potential sub segment to target when marketing museums to young adults. In addition, a majority of them has an overall positive image of museums, thereby contrasting the theory that young adults tend to see museums as boring, didactic and unapproachable. However, the motivations of visit found in this study shows that practicality can motivate young adults to visit museum. Among respondents who have never visited museums in the last three years, the main reason for not visiting was the lack of time, followed by lack of interest in museum, and lack of information about the museum offerings. Other reasons for not visiting museum include the preference for other activities, difficulties in getting required information about museums and the tendency to put off visiting until a later date and the perception that museum admission fees are too pricy. A very small percentage of the respondents simply indicated that they do not like to visit museum. Brochures, strong web presence and guides in the museums are promotional tools that youth would like to see. Lower admission fees. More attractive museum collections and displays and updated website information are additional measures museum marketers can take in trying to reach and specifically target this young adults market segment",M
"Hanita Sarah Saad","REGULATING ATYPICAL EMPLOYMENT IN THE MALAYSIAN PRIVATE SECTOR: BALANCING FLEXIBILITY AND SECURITY","Atypical employment is a new breed of employment manifested by flexible and precarious work arrangements like part-time work and fixed-term contracts. Atypical employment provides the elasticity required by modern organisation to respond quickly to market demands without compromising their competiveness and productivity. Despite providing such flexibility, atypical employments are often said to erode workers rights, robbing them of job security and social security enjoyed by the regular permanent employees. Nevertheless, atypical employment continues to be an important facet of modern workforce and stakeholders in the labour market have been urged to recognise and accommodate these non-standard works within the regular labour laws framework to provide better protection to the workers. This paper investigates the incidence of fixed-term employment contracts and part-time work among private companies in the Klang Valley and examines the issues and legal problems facing the workers in connection to their work. Subsequently through such analysis, several legislative measures and recommendations are put forward so that the many advantages conferred by atypical employment may be reaped without sacrificing the protection and security that should be enjoyed by all workers in this country",M

Revenue management is the ability of the hotel to sell the right product to the right customer at the right time with the right price through the right distribution channels. The concept was initiated and successfully implemented in the early 1990s by the airlines companies which then being adapted by most hotels since both industries have similar characteristics. Those characteristics are the ability to segment the markets, perishable inventory, product sold in advance, fluctuating demand, low marginal sales costs, and high marginal production costs. In implementing the concept, hotel operators need to maximize the room rates when the demand is high and to maximize the room sales when the demand is low. However, such practices often leads to unfairness issues that could jeopardize the relationship between the hotels and the customers and perception of price fairness is believed associated well with the customer response behaviors. This study empirically investigates the effect of the factors influencing the perception of price fairness on customer response behaviors. Four factors were being tested namely, a) treatment experience, b) price knowledge, c) price expectation, and d) price information. Using self-reported questionnaire survey among the four and five star hotel customers some meaningful insights on the issues investigated were obtained. Findings revealed the experience that customer gained throughout their staying in the hotel positively influence their response behaviors while knowledge that customers obtained pertaining to room rates negatively influence their response behaviors. Customer perceptions and judgments of price unfairness however will lead to negative emotional response like no action, self-protection, and revenge. These results not only provide the hotel operators in understanding of the customers behaviors but way to implement an effective revenue management in their operation.",M

Accountants, in this context, are not an exception. The availability of such ethical code of conduct is extremely important for both accountants and users of accounting information. However, currently in Yemen, there is no ethical code of conduct for Yemeni professional accountants. Hence, a study was conducted to develop an ethical code of conduct for Yemeni professional accountants from an Islamic perspective, given that Yemen is an Islamic country. In particular, the study sought to address the question of what constitutes the ethical code of conduct among Yemeni professional accountants. To address the question, data were collected from 386 users of accounting information in four main cities of Yemen i.e. Sanaa, Hadhramout, Taiz, and Aden. The participants were asked to indicate their expectations about what should be included in the ethical code conduct for Yemeni professional accountants. The study employed interdependency analysis, specifically exploratory factor analysis, to reveal the domains of ethical code of conduct. Results show that the ethical code of conduct consists of seven constructs, i.e. acting responsibly, honoring the public trust, acting with integrity, maintaining objectivity and independence, exercising due care, following the limits of scope and nature of services, and complying with Adel, Sabr, and Ihsan principles. The findings could be used by policy makers to develop an ethical code of conduct for Yemeni accountants to assist them with their professional work.

Research in the field of leadership has never been saturated with theoretical and conceptual quests for leadership styles that work with any situation and followers condition. Bernard Bass, for instance has adopted the political leadership paradigm of transactional and transformational leadership styles introduced by Burn to the social science fields. Efforts by Bass were well accepted by other researchers and enormous studies have been done to test the applicability of the leadership paradigm in many sub-fields of social sciences for the past 30 years. Studies have found that transformational leadership style leads to increased productivity, employee morale, job satisfaction, organizational commitment and organizational citizenship behavior. The findings also suggest that the latter compliments the transactional leadership style. However, recently scepticism was raised on the ability of the transformational leadership style to effectively fulfil followers inner need and with respect to the lack of spiritual element in the ethical conduct of leaders. Hence, this brings interest in research on a new leadership paradigm which takes into account the spiritual element in leadership. In spiritual leadership, questions are raised about what it means to be human, what we really mean by growth and what value and power distributions are needed to enhance both organizations and society as a whole. This paper attempts to investigate further these questions in the context of the various leadership styles mentioned.

However, most countries operate under conventional banking laws, and it is futile to expect the situation to change; and it does not need to change. The interaction between the traditional Islamic and the conventional Western bank will make possible the setting up of a new type of bank, i.e. riba-free commercial banks. This riba-free commercial bank will serve as a new paradigm for global banking. Under the riba-free commercial bank, all current account services rendered by the conventional model will be provided. The difference is that where, in the conventional system, six components (interest, services cost, overhead costs, risk premium, profit, compensation for inflation) are treated as a compound to justify riba, the riba-free commercial system treats these components separately in order to avoid riba. The result will be that interest stands to be charged, while riba is to be prohibited. Riba-free, but not cost-free, loans and advances will form the basis of riba-free commercial banking. It means that riba-free commercial banks must be free of the encumbrances of charitable loans. In this riba-free commercial model, interest is to be associated with trade or profit, which is permissible in Islam. In riba-free commercial banking, aspects of both conventional and Islamic finances are combined. This will allow Islamic societies to have the best of both worlds, and this is the model of banking the world is waiting for. It is now up to the Muslim and conventional bankers and others to take steps to establish such riba-free commercial banks (not interest-free) in all countries of the world",M

The impact of high unemployment rate is direct, right after the recession or the decrease of output growth. It is therefore important to discover the effect of the relationship because from there, we will be able to effectively determine the suitable policy. This paper tends to examine the existence of Okuns relationship in terms of Malaysia context using a rather new econometric approach. The relationship is measured by applying the first difference and gap model with Hodrick-Prescott filter (HP filter), furthered with Autogressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) to determine the co-integration between the variables and their causality.  The main reason of applying ARDL is because of the small sample of data and its applicability on the order of integration, which is regardless even if the regressors are stationary. Additional to that, the method enables us to find the relationship between unemployment and output without determining the natural rate of output nor natural rate of unemployment",M

Findings from this study show that there is a difference between male-led and female-led companies with firm performance. Male owners are found to enhance greater firm value than female owners, when based on the market value (Tobins Q). In term of owners age, both  the market value (Q) and accounting value (EPS) do show a negative relationship with business performance. This explains that matured owners are found to be underperformed, while the young owners are more aggressive in enhancing the firm value.

It was also useful in attracting new customers as they compete effectively in the market place. However, due to the characteristics of services, it makes consistent service delivery very difficult across customers. Some aspects of services which relates to employee actions and customer attitude are outside the control of managers. Consequently, service failure is inevitable, sometimes mistakes will happen or things will go wrong, and so service recovery action is needed to deal with the mistakes or problems in order  to restore customer satisfaction. This study attempted to analyse the service failures and recovery in service organizations. Data were collected by using Flanagans Critical Incident Techniques i.e. interviewing customers who had experienced service failures in restaurants (102), hotels (213) and transportation (51) industries in Malaysia. The result of the analysis shown that on the overall, 239 (65%) of the respondents were dissatisfied and 127(35%) of them were satisfied.

Findings showed that 4 demographic variables i.e. gender, educational level, occupation and monthly income and 3 dining-out behavior i.e. frequency of visit, dining-out companion (with family) and reason for dining-out (special occasion) were found to have significant association with consumers purchasing orientation. 4 demographic variables i.e. gender, educational level, occupation and income were shown as significant determinants of consumer purchasing orientation. The findings of this study should be of interest to this industry. The profiling of the demographics and dining-out behaviour of the consumers of fine dining restaurant as well as the creation of a logistic regression equation to predict the probability of cluster membership will help restaurateurs understand their customers better and enable effective actions for business improvement via accurate business forecasting and target segments that are much more likely to patronize their restaurant",M

In spate of global financial crisis, banks in Nigeria experienced credit crunch as a result of economic downturn, squeeze profit from economic sectors and high inflationary trend. In this paper, effort was be made to develop a statistical model that explains the behavior of banks in the period of the crisis.  More importantly, the study seeks to established causal relationship between factors that affects supply of loans viz a viz rate of return, total deposits, and inflation rate. Using dynamics econometric analysis and ordinary least square regression techniques the results reveal that liquidity position proxied by total deposits has significant influence on the behavior of banks this contradicts REE framework. Secondly, global financial crisis significantly affects the bank lending behavior, however on contrary regulatory intervention has less influence on the behavior.  The study is expected to yield an immense benefit to policy makers who strive to stimulate economic growth through monetary and cyclical regulatory policies",M

Two motivations for this study were the lack of academic research in this industry and its importance in the economy. Sixteen companies with current asset greater than 50% of total asset, for the period 2005-2009, were selected. Principal Component Analysis PCA was used to extract, from 20 variables and ratios, five factors that impact financial performance. The variable with the biggest component loading in each one of the five factors was selected to be its representative in the multiple regression analysis MRA. Finally, MRA is used to assert which indicators affect corporate profitability the most as measured by ROS return on sales, ROA return on assets and ROE return on equity. The results show that five factors impact corporate financial performance with 18 correlated variables and ratios. The firm size factor is the most predominant and accounts for 26,9% of total variance, while the financial debt is the least important, accounting for 9,1%. Percentage of gross margin and the amount of equity are the indicators that impact the profitability, while financial leverage impacts only ROE. The first two indicators account for 50,7% and 73,4% of ROS and ROA variances respectively, while they, together with financial leverage, account for 72,7% of ROE variance. Working capital indicators account for 20,8% of financial performance variance but none of them affects profitability. The findings can provide experience sharing for other industries and also for cyclical consumer goods industry in other countries, which can be of interest to international audience of academics and business managers. The originality of this study was to combine both techniques: the use of PCA to identify the most relevant indicator in each factor followed by a MRA to assert which indicators affect the corporate profitability the most",M
"Tan Teck-Hong","BASE LENDING RATE AND HOUSING PRICES: THEIR IMPACTS ON RESIDENTIAL HOUSING ACTIVITIES IN MALAYSIA","The construction sector, which had grown rapidly in the early 1990s, encountered slower grows after the financial crisis. The decline in the construction industry, however, is cushioned by the residential property construction. This paper examines empirically whether the increasing trend in residential property construction is related to changes in base lending rate and house prices. Pooled EGLS model (Cross Section Seemingly Unrelated Regression) is used to analyze the impact of lending rate and housing price upon the trading volume of residential housing activities. The results show base lending rate is the key determinant of residential housing activities. However, changes in housing prices may not necessarily influence residential housing activities in the country when there is a mismatch between current and desired housing for all. In view of the substantial number of housing left unsold, several recommendation and precautionary measures for housing provision should be made before it leads to property glut. This study is crucial to housing developers and policy makers as any housing decisions not always should be made just on the basis of interest rates and house prices, but should pay more attention to the efficiency and effectiveness of housing delivery system in the country",M

However, there are quite a few studies done on Islamic human resource practices.  Using simple random sampling technique, final copies of questionnaires were sent to 300 Islamic organizations.  However, only 114 questionnaires were returned and 111 were usable. These Islamic organizations implement Islamic human resource practices due to Islam; the religion is the way of life, type of their organizations and organizational mission.  Two Islamic human resource practices were being implemented to a considerable extent are selection and recruitment and training and development. On the other hand, three Islamic human resource practices were being implemented to a moderate extent which are career development, performance management and reward practices.  Thus, the overall implementation of Islamic human resource practices in Malaysian Islamic organizations is moderate.  However, the impact of these Islamic human resource practices on organizational performance is considerable. This shows that Islamic human resource practices are better than the conventional perspective in producing higher organizational performance",M

Thus, it is essential to analyze the means of measuring and evaluating service quality provided by banking institutions as they adjust to the dynamic changes in the banking environment. Previous studies have produced scales that bear a resemblance to generic measures of service quality, which may not be totally adequate in assessing the perceived quality in the banking sector. This study aims to identify and validate the dimensions of service quality within the banking sector in Malaysia from the customers perspective. A proposed 29-item instrument has been empirically tested for unidimensionality, reliability and validity using both exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis. A factorial analysis suggests that service quality has three dimensions namely Systemization of service delivery, Reliable Communication and Responsiveness. A subsequent multiple regression analysis revealed that Systemization is the most important service quality dimension within the banking sector",M

Sesame, one of the high potential export commodities from Myanmar, was also distorted by government export tax policy to shrink the volume of trade. The study investigated the impacts of imposing export tax on sesame seed trade with the assumption of dominant exporting country. To understand the closely related market nature, sesame market structure was estimated in the multi-market frameworks using simultaneous equations. Partial equilibrium view of policy simulation was further examined for clarification of alternative policy impacts (10%, 8%, and 5% export tax) on market participants. Simulation results reported that current export tax caused the consumers surplus in both direct consumption and crushing sectors. A part from this it showed the best results not only in government revenue but also in society surplus. The recommendation can therefore be drawn out from this study that the export volume should not totally be banned and the export tax should not be totally eliminated for this commodity. Thereafter, the tax revenue should be used in sesame industry improvement",M

If one of the instruments faces default problems so the other instrument will also get the effect of this case. This research tries to examine the impact of the default to the Islamic equity return. This research also study about the correlation between the size, book to market ratio (BM) and the default probability (DP). This research use Mertons model to determine the probability default in Islamic capital market. This is the first research that uses the Mertons model to determine and to predict the default probability of the Islamic company. To answer the research question this study focuses in Islamic capital market in Malaysia that well-known as a leader in Islamic finance. It uses regression to examine the impact of the size, BM to PD. In addition, to measure impact of the PD to Islamic equity return this research also uses regression model. This Research find several conclusions. First, size of Islamic company has negative influence to the PD. If the size of firm increases 1% the PD will decrease around 1.112E-05. Between size and PD there is medium correlation that is shown by the R square which is about 34.9%. Second, Book to Market ratio does not have significant correlation with the PD. Third, this research also finds that the PD does not have impact to the return of Islamic equity.

The first theory perceived that tax compliance is deterred by sanction (Title, C. 1980). Second Theory perceived tax compliance as purely economic decision (Allingham & Sandmo, 1972), while the third theory suggested that tax compliance is determined by non economic factor such as demographic attributes, attitudes and perception towards taxation. In this study, we try to understand tax compliance by using the third model (Kinsey, 1986). Hence, the objectives of this study are (1) to examine the relationship between satisfaction towards the services provided by the Inland Revenue Board (IRB) and tax compliance; (2) to examine the relationship between knowledge on taxation and tax compliance; and (3) to determine factors that contributed to the satisfaction towards the services provided by the IRB. Satisfaction towards the services provided and knowledge on taxation are the independent variables of this study, meanwhile tax compliance, which being measured by timeliness of submitting the tax return is the dependent variables. In addition, 9 point Likert Scale questions have being used to measure the level of satisfaction. Meanwhile, to measure the respondents knowledge on taxation, 10 questions on taxation are given, and the respondents need to state whether the answer is True or False. 300 questionnaires were distributed to sole proprietors in three states in East Coast Region. In return, we received 199 responses from the respondents, which results to 66.3% response rate. By using Cross tabulation, the result indicates that there are relationship between satisfaction and tax compliance, where out of 10 questions given, 4 questions on satisfaction are significantly correlated with tax compliance. Furthermore, Chi- square analysis also indicates that there is correlation between tax knowledge and tax compliance. In addition, factor analysis conducted depicts that 3 questions contributed to the level of satisfaction, which are overall satisfaction towards the services provided by the IRB, satisfaction towards the time taken to process the tax return, and the time taken to process the tax refund.

This goal can be achieved when new investors are attracted to trade on companies shares. Among different groups of investors, individual investors are generally less able to objectively evaluate companies risks and returns, and tend to be emotionally biased in their trading decisions. Therefore their decisions may be formed as a result of perceived risks and returns, and influenced by companies images. This study finds that attitude towards brand mediates moderately the relationships between its perceptual antecedents and individual investors trading decisions. This finding suggests that in courting individual investors, companies may adopt adequate marketing strategies to leverage with their current financial performance as such strategies should enhance their images that attract investors to trade on their shares.",M

This paper provides an empirical study on the relationship between efficiency and organizational structure for takaful operators in Malaysian dual financial system. A sample of 19 firms is chosen over the period 2004-2009. The selection of inputs and outputs are based on flow approach consistent with Leverty and Grace (2009). The study employed non parametric approach that is Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) with input orientation measurement to estimate the technical efficiency for both industries. This study applied constant return to scale (CRS) and variable return to scale (VRS) to separate the scale efficiency from the technical efficiency. A Mann Whitney test is employed to examine any significant difference in efficiency between takaful and insurance industry. The findings indicate that there is a significant difference in technical efficiency between takaful industry and insurance industry. It is found that takaful has lower technical efficiency than conventional insurance. Importantly, it shows the organization form has an influence on the efficiency.

The revolution in information technology has paved the way to realize new tools, which may aid in different aspect to life. The most essential characteristics of the Internet are that information can be accesses at almost anytime and from anywhere. Consistent with the advancement of the Internet as a cheap but powerful communication device, disclosure of financial information on the Internet is becoming an increasingly popular subject of research. Many have investigated the extent, mode and quality of Internet Financial Reporting (IFR) over the last decade. However, most of early IFR researches are descriptive and exploratory in nature, thus unable to explain the phenomenon. Further, while many have conceded that a suitable proxy such as an index of disclosure can be used to gain insight into the sophistication of information disclosed by companies, to date, very few attempts have been made to develop such index. Of these few studies, the dimensions used to represent IFR are inconsistent among the researchers. These differences contribute to the variations in the findings and thus unable to clearly explain factors influencing the behaviour of the IFR. Therefore, this paper aims to address the issue of IFR index, by carefully reviewing existing literature relating to the topic. This issue is of particular importance to researchers since disclosure is an abstract concept that cannot be measured directly. A more comprehensive index which consists of several dimensions is hoped to assist the researchers to better explain the practices of IFR and its determinants.",M

Index number methodology for assessing the changes in quality of traded goods is applied to goods subject to parallel import competition in the European Union during 1995-2004. The claim that parallel import competition leads to a reduction in quality over time is not substantiated after analyzing the changes in the quality of imports to Sweden and Finland (who joined the EU in 1995 and subsequently opened their markets to parallel trade) and comparing them to changes in quality in the rest of the EU.",F

The model is estimated simultaneously for 8 markets: the world market, 4 developed markets and 3 emerging markets. This approach allows to the price of market risk, betas and correlations to vary through time.  The evidence supports the financial integration hypothesis and suggests that investors from all countries could expect statistically significant benefits from international diversification but that gains are considerably larger for investors with smaller home markets",F

The true burden of undiagnosed pre-diabetes is found to be considerably more than the numbers estimated by the American Diabetes Association. Men are found to be more likely to have undiagnosed pre-diabetes. Prevalence rates vary considerably between different racial,  gender, and age groups. There is no strong evidence that  systematic racial disparities exist. There is weak evidence that members of the minority communities may have slightly lower likelihood of suffering from undiagnosed prediabetes compared to non-Hispanic whites. This evidence is more pronounced for men than for women. Higher  prevalence of undiagnosed pre-diabetes among minorities especially in the early stages of lives may be partially responsible for overall racial disparities in diabetes in the country. Stopping 50% of the undiagnosed pre-diabetes cases from developing into diabetes will save US over $600 billion in current dollars.",I

"Achintya  Ray","City-Size and Health Outcomes: Lessons from the USA","In this paper, we compare health outcomes in cities of different sizes. Using 2001 National Health Interview Survey data for adult urban-US population, it is shown that individual health is better in bigger cities compared to small or medium sized ones. This result holds after controlling for potentially confounding variables including age, gender, education, marital status, smoking, income, asset-ownership, and race. Possible sources of selection bias are controlled using many model specifications and population sub-groupings. Although, stiff challenges for healthcare delivery exist for large cities, an aggressive urban health policy should also put strong emphasis on improving health in small and medium sized cities to reduce urban health disparities in the USA. Policy implications for other developed and developing countries are also hypothesized.",I

Based on new theoretical developments in migration theories, it develops an empirical model which highlights the main migration determinants in the EU. As a next step, the model is estimated with the Hausman and Taylor as well as the GMM panel data estimators. The observed/fitted migration ratios are subsequently calculated from an out-sample technique. Results show that there is still a significant migration potential from Maghreb countries towards Southern European countries. A second significant potential concerns the new Eastern neighbors with regard to Germany and Eastern EU countries.",F

This paper provides the first comparative estimation of trade and FDI potentials between the USA and these new partner countries. We first derive a dynamic two-equation trade and FDI model, which is afterwards estimated with GMM. Trade and FDI potentials are then calculated from these models' residuals with an out-of-sample technique. Results highlight significant US trade and FDI potential regarding Maghreb countries, Indonesia, as well as SACU. However, the free trade initiative with most ASEAN countries is expected to have limited effects, given that these countries have already outstripped their potential trade and FDI flows with the USA.",F
"Giulia  Bettin","The remittance behaviour of African diaspora in Belgium","The Belgium International Remittance Senders Household Survey (IRSHS) is employed to investigate the factors influencing remittance behaviour of the African diaspora in Belgium. The rich information contained in the dataset makes it possible to include both senders' and recipients' characteristics in the empirical model, which is not very common in much of the applied literature on remittances. Different motivations for tranfers seem to coexist: altruistic feelings certainly play an important role but at the same time remittances might be part of an implicit contract between the migrant and the family back home. In particular, the fact that the amount remitted rises with senders' education - even after controlling for migrants' income - may be supportive of the repayment hypothesis.",F

The relationship between REIT performance and house price or other financial variables represents important information for the risk management strategy of investors. Using a vector error correction model (VECM), the analysis found that in the long run, there exists a positive correlation between US equity REIT returns and house price. Our results reveal that if house prices in the US decline or the inflation index rises, the REIT performance will   in the long run. Our empirical results also indicate that in recent years, there appears to be a stronger positive correlation between US equity REIT returns and house price.",M

We use the procedure developed by Di Nardo et al (1996) and Melly (2005) to decompose the productivity gap across the entire productivity distribution in order to account for the relative importance of observed characteristics versus different returns. We find that the productivity gap suffered by firms that invest only in less developed countries is due to lower efficiency, not to worse characteristics. The most productive firms are those able to invest in both developed and less developed countries. They outperform firms investing only in one geographical area because of their better characteristics.",F

Most papers studying this question define regions according to normative criteria, even though this can lead to biased conclusions. In contrast, this article explores the per capita income (PCI) distribution of metropolitan regions defined by a functional criterion, the agglomerated population. Specifically, we examine the external shape and internal movements of the PCI distribution in a sample of 235 European metropolitan regions over the period 1995 to 2006. The results describe a process of income convergence among these regions.",R
"Hilde  BjÃ¸rnland","Estimating the equilibrium real exchange rate in Venezuela","To determine whether the real exchange rate is misaligned with respect to its long-run equilibrium is an important issue for policy makers. This paper clarifies and calculates the concept of the equilibrium real exchange rate, using a structural vector autoregression (VAR) model. By imposing long-run restrictions on a VAR model for Venezuela, four structural shocks are identified: Nominal demand, real demand, supply and oil price shocks. The identified shocks and their impulse responses are consistent with an open economy model of economic fluctuations and highlight the role of the exchange rate in the transmission mechanism of an oil-producing country.",F
"Jeng-Bau  Lin","Nonlinear Mean Reversion and Arbitrage in the Gold Futures Market","Previous literatures take transaction costs as being negligible when analyzing the futures basis behavior in linear dynamic framework. However, we argue that the relationship between the futures and spot prices with the conventional linear cointegration approach may not be appropriate after taking transaction costs into account. In this paper, an incorporation of transaction costs presented by Dumas (1992) and Michael (1997) into the exponential smooth transition autoregressive (ESTAR) model developed by Granger and Terasvita (1993) is motivated to examine the dynamic relationship between daily gold futures and spot prices and the nonlinear behavior of the gold futures basis. Transaction costs may lead to the existence of neutral band for futures market speculation within which profitable trading opportunities are impossible. Further, our results indicate that the ESTAR model provides higher forecasting power than the linear AR(1) model.",F

"Mark D.  White","Strategic Trade Policy with Polynomial Costs","&#65279 We investigate how the superiority of the optimal subsidy or tariff in an international Cournot oligopoly depends on the production technology used in the industry, an interesting issue that has not been analyzed in the literature.  We establish that the welfare superiority of the optimal subsidy or tariff depends on the relative steepness of the firms' common marginal cost curve: when it is relatively steep, tariffs are superior to subsidies in enhancing domestic welfare, and vice versa.  When both instruments are used simultaneously, the tariff component becomes more important as the marginal cost curve steepens.",F
"Sankar  Mukhopadhyay","Analyzing the impact of prenatal care on infant health:  do we have useful input and output measures?","Recent work raises questions about the input and output measures typically used to estimate the impact of prenatal care on infant health:  self-reported prenatal care may generate biased estimates of the impact of prenatal care on infant health, and birthweight may be a narrow measure of infant health that leads to underestimation of the impact of prenatal care on delivery outcomes. We link data from a prenatal care clinic, the associated hospital and the relevant birth certificate records to analyze these measurement issues.  We conclude that low birthweight is not meaningful measure of infant health for the purpose of estimating the relation between prenatal care and delivery outcomes.  In addition, the discrepancy between provider-reported and self-reported care is substantial, the correlation between these two measures is low, and the estimated relationship between prenatal care and infant health is not robust with respect to reliance on self-reported vs. provider-reported care.",I
"Juliette  Milgram-Baleix","Intra-industry trade with emergent countries: what can we learn from spanish data?","In this paper, we study the nature of Spanish intra-industry trade and find that intra-industry trade with CEEC, Asian and Mediterranean countries has increased considerably since the middle of the Nineties. The second aim of the paper is to study if the comparative advantage argument also explains the vertical intra-industry trade between different income countries. According to OLS estimations, technological differences increase DVIIT while physical capital differences lead to its decrease. The results obtained applying the Heckman method support the idea that differences in physical capital reduce the probability of IIT to occur but the level of vertical and horizontal IIT is more accurately explained by the proximity of partners, similarity in development level and size of market than by the differences in physical capital endowments. The variables considered, mostly country-specific, do have the same impact on vertical and horizontal IIT with emergent countries.",F

We test for cointegration using two data sets: a) annual data for 15 countries between 1965 and 2004  and b) annual data for 22 countries between 1984 and 2004. We find that cointegration is present and that, indeed, there is a stable import demand function in these economies. The income elasticity ranges from 1.26 to 1.69 and price elasticity ranges from -0.72 to -0.75.",F

We first present a theoretical description of the risk indicator. Then, we calculate this measure for the British economy in the period of study. In general, the results reveal a very small increase of external risk. Finally, the relationship between the two dimensions of external risk: trade openness and external volatility is analysed.",F
"Chien-Fu  Chen","Does PPP hold for Big Mac price or consumer price index? Evidence from panel cointegration","This paper examines the validity of purchasing power parity (PPP)  using CPI and Big Mac prices.  The benchmark model, i.e., the OLS  method, which does not take nonstationarity into account, rejects  the hypothesis of PPP regardless of prices used.  We next use the panel cointegration method to consider the nonstationary nature of variables. Estimated results for CPI are mixed.  The PPP is rejected when the nominal exchange rate is employed as the dependent variable but is not rejected when the price ratio is used as the dependent variable.  By contrast, the PPP is overwhelmingly not rejected when the Big Mac price is used.  Last, we remove the production bias and re-examine the same issue by using panel cointegration.  The PPP is again decisively rejected when CPI price is used but not for Big Mac price.  Accordingly, Big Mac price  is more supportive to the validity of PPP than CPI price.",F

In reality however, non-members do react to the creation of a trading bloc and relaxing this assumption can provide useful insights.  Using a political economy model, this paper explore the case where those excluded countries can adjust their commercial policies in order to minimize the negative effects of the PTA.  It is shown that the creation of a PTA can lead the excluded countries to increase their trade barriers with respect to the PTA members.",F

However, it is unclear whether their fiscal and monetary policies are effective in this regard.    We examine the relationship between the U.S. trade balance and the G-7 countriesÂf policy variables by constructing an eight-dimensional version of the structural vector autoregression (SVAR) model.  Our empirical results suggest that a reduction in the U.S. fiscal deficit is not such a reliable instrument for reducing the U.S. trade imbalance. Contrastingly, monetary tightening in the U.S. can reduce its trade deficit. Non-U.S. policy shocks are ineffective, while decline in the U.S. dollar plays an important role in reducing the U.S. trade deficit.",F

"Laura  Romero","On the role of borrowing constraints in public and private universities' choices","We investigate the reasons why universities use different combinations of fees and exams to guide admission decisions, focusing on the role of borrowing constraints on such decisions. On the one hand, we show that public universities choose exams and zero fees under borrowing constraints because exams are efficient allocation devices, and the objective of public institutions is the maximization of surplus. On the other hand, private universities prefer the use of fees to guide admission policies since tuition fees are not only an allocation device but also a source of revenues. Interestingly, we find that while borrowing constraints do not affect quality and admission standards in the public university, they reduce both quality and fees in the private.",I

Three hundred and fifty web portal site users were obtained from a survey. Data analysis using LISREL shows that all three models meet the various goodness-of-fit criteria. In terms of variance explained for intention to continue IS usage, all three models perform equally well. As for the explanatory power of satisfaction, Model 3 has the highest R2 (71%), followed by Model 2 (69%), and Model 1 (68%). This result confirms the erstwhile discussion of continuance intention behavior in which adding emotion factors to the cognitive process model will enhance the predictive power of the satisfaction.",M

"Sofiane Hicham  Sekioua","The Nominal Exchange Rate and Monetary Fundamentals: Evidence from Nonlinear Unit Root Tests","In this paper we model the deviation of the nominal exchange rate from the long run equilibrium level predicted by monetary fundamentals in a nonlinear framework consistent with the presence of transaction costs. In contrast to standard linear methods and studies which test for linearity only, we consider a novel approach that allows for the joint testing of nonlinearity and nonstationarity. Within this approach, we employ nonlinear threshold autoregressive (TAR) unit root tests to investigate whether the deviation of the nominal exchange rate from the level predicted by monetary fundamentals for three major currencies vis-Ã -vis the US dollar is mean reverting. We are able to reject the null hypotheses of linearity and nonstationarity indicating nonlinear mean reversion of the deviation of the exchange rate from monetary fundamentals. Further, large deviations are found to have faster speed of mean reversion than small deviations.",F

Evidence from Malaysia","For decades, the conventional wisdom for a developing nation striving to achieve an impressive economic growth has been to carve a niche in the global marketplace. However, empirical findings of various research studies on the âexport-led growthâ hypothesis do not provide a solid evidence to support this viewpoint. The current paper chooses one of the âEast Asian Miracleâ economies, Malaysia, to empirically examine whether exports act as the âengineâ of growth.  The results of the empirical analysis do not support the âexport-led growthâ hypothesis. Rather, they lead to a conclusion that there exists a âvirtuous cycleâ or mutually reinforcing relationship between Malaysia's exports and GDP in the long run. The findings also detected unidirectional short run causality from GDP to exports, but not vice versa. This means that the increase in Malaysia''s export tends to be an effect, and not the cause, of the country''s output expansion.",F

Results are presented for the heterogeneous noncausality hypothesis (HENC), which tests, for each cross-section unit, the nullity of all the coefficients of the lagged explanatory variable. Bilateral causality relation is observed for 5 countries out of 44 (11% of the countries in our data set). We have 18 countries of unidirectional causality, which 14 are from HIV mortality rate to GDP (43% from total), and 4 are from GDP to HIV mortality rate (9% from total). These results alert for the risk of epidemic trap, initiated first by the deleterious effect of HIV-Aids on countries income.",I

The results provide evidence of income divergence between Japan and each of the ASEAN-5 economies. To avoid the problem associated with structural break, this study proceeds with the jointly crash and changes in trend model proposed by Zivot and Andrews (1992), and is able to obtain evidence of long run income convergence between the Japanese and Singaporean economies. As for the rest of the four ASEAN countries- Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand, the earlier results of income divergence remain valid and hence suggest that it would be a more realistic and urgent goal to narrow the income gap among these five core economies of ASEAN.",F

However, we argue that the relationship between the futures and spot prices with the conventional linear cointegration approach may not be appropriate after taking transaction costs into account. In this paper, an incorporation of transaction costs presented by Dumas (1992) and Michael (1997) into the exponential smooth transition autoregressive (ESTAR) model developed by Granger and Terasvita (1993) is motivated to examine the dynamic relationship between daily gold futures and spot prices and the nonlinear behavior of the gold futures basis.

Firms in North fragment their business into two parts: assembly and services. A reduction in the cost of services to coordinate fragmented businesses between North and South does not enhance fragmentation. On the contrary, the arrival rate of imitation accelerates and that of innovation slows down. Consequently, the life of Northern goods becomes shorter and that of Southern copies becomes longer. We also derive other results to compare to those in Grossman and Helpman (1991) and in Glass and Saggi (2001).",F
"Dan  Friesner","Ownership and rent-seeking behavior in specialty health care practices","Specialty health care practices are unique in that they exhibit a wide range of ownership types, from large corporations controlled by third parties to those directly owned by practitioners (physicians, therapists, etc.).  Many of these practices also employ licensed assistants whose labor is partially substitutable with those of the practitioners.  This paper presents a theoretical model that examines the impact that different levels of ownership have on rent-seeking behavior and efficiency within specialty practices.  Our primary focus is on whether lower levels of ownership induce practitioners to extract larger economic rents by substituting their services for those of their assistants.  We find that if the practitioners are not required to be technically efficient then they unambiguously respond to lower ownership with rent-seeking.  However, requiring the firm to be technically (but not allocatively) efficient, may be sufficient to mitigate this incentive.",I

"Kazuhiro  Takauchi","Rules of origin and international R&D rivalry","We study a three-country three-firm free trade area (FTA) trade model with rules of origin (ROO) under international R&D competition. The external tariff is chosen by the country importing final goods in the FTA. If the FTA chooses a higher content rate of ROO, the country importing final goods chooses a higher tariff in order to compensate for lower consumer surplus. We have three results. First, if the FTA raises the content rate, it raises the costs of exporters within the area, but if the R&D cost is sufficiently low, the exporters actually increase exports and their profits also increase. Second, if the firms within the FTA are less efficient than outsiders, the social welfare of countries importing final goods is affected by the content rate in a U-shaped fashion. A tightening of ROO may reduce the social welfare of importing countries since it may replace productive firms outside the FTA with less productive local firms. Third, if the productivity within an FTA is relatively high, the optimal content rate of ROO for the importing country within the FTA is 100%. In that case, the country importing final goods does not need to rely on imports from outside. Since an increase in the content rate of ROO increases external tariff, the most stringent ROO requirement is desirable for that country.",F

McLaren (1997) casts aspersions on this traditional belief by demonstrating that irreversible investment in the small country, with the possibility of re-negotiation by the large country, can actually make the small country prefer autarky to free trade. In this note, we identify a middle ground where the small country can realize above-autarky utility by only partially specializing (relative to the free-trade level of specialization) in export production  this improvement occurs even in the presence of irreversible investment and deferred negotiations.",F

Given such political difficulties, the London scheme seems to be very attractive.  In this paper, we develop a model that can expressly deal with the London-type revenue-recycling between congestion tax and investment in public transit, and analyze its effects.",R

When the marginal cost differential is âsignificantly large,â the home firm's ability to put the foreign firm at the risk of an AD violation is limited.  But when the marginal cost differential is âsignificantly small,â the home firm is able to increase its output and lower the price of the product below its normal value, putting the foreign firm in the situation of an illegal dumping.  One interesting implication is that, relative to the case without an AD law, the home firm has a stronger incentive to undertake cost-reducing activities (e.g., R&D investment or the adoption of a more efficient technology) under the law.",F

This segmentational approach is applicable to various expert systems including, but not limited to, those used for the mass appraisal. The proposed approach may be useful for various regression analysis applications, especially those with strong heteroscedasticity. It helps to reveal segments for which separate models or appraiser assistance are desirable. The segmentational approach has been applied to a mass appraisal model based on the Random Forest algorithm.",R

The existence of such relationship is probably resulted from the strong and consistent bilateral trade relationship between the Philippines and Japan. Results from various monetary restrictions tests suggest that other forms of the related monetary model are not suitable in the determination of the peso-yen exchange rate.",F
"Hiroshi  Gunji","Standard error and confidence interval for QALY weights","There are some problems with the standard errors of QALY weights proposed by Groot (2000, Journal of Health Economics 19). The standard errors show smaller values than those of Groot when we recalculate using his method. Moreover, we correct the derivation of his approximation and derive corrected values. Because mean and variance do not exist for a distribution of QALY weights, using standard errors for statistical inference may lead to problems even when an approximation is used. In this paper, we verify the statistical properties of Groot's standard errors by simulation. We find that the corrected standard errors hold the same properties as a normal distribution under specific conditions. In general, however, it would be appropriate to use our simulation method to obtain critical values or p-value.",I
"Nicolas  Houy","Are better vaccines really better? The case of a simple stochastic epidemic SIR model","We consider a model of vaccine market where the buyer is centralized and shows an endogenous demand function based on a simple stochastic SIR model. When the seller is a monopoly, we show that better vaccines (in the sense of greater efficiency or inducing less side-effects) do not imply greater total surplus, greater buyer surplus or even greater profits. Since we consider a centralized buyer, our results cannot be caused by the well-known epidemiological externality of vaccination.",I

The aim of this study is to analyze the pattern of trade in services in Europe. In considering the three main important RTAs in force in Europe, I find that all the RTAs do not have similar impacts on trade in services. Indeed, European Union and European Economic Area are trade creating while European Free Trade Association (EFTA) does not have a significant impact on intra-members trade and is more trade diverting than the other RTAs. Moreover, new entrants have a positive propensity to trade services with the members of the EFTA. Trade impacts of a given RTA vary substantially across signatories.",F

"Bree J Lang","Does offering more Advanced Placement courses increase enrollment?","This study utilizes a grant in California that required a group of high schools to increase the number of Advanced Placement (AP) courses offered to their students. The grant provides an arguably exogenous increase in the number of AP courses offered in a school. Using an instrumental variable approach, this analysis shows that offering an additional AP course does not increase total enrollment in AP courses. Instead, students substitute out of other AP subjects to enroll in the new subject being offered. This result suggests that additional AP course access is unlikely to induce students to enroll in more AP courses.",I

"Tony  Cavoli","A note on exchange rate regimes in Asia: Are they really what they claim to be?","This paper presents an analysis of the degree of de facto exchange rate flexibility in the exchange rate regimes for selected emerging Asian economies over the decade 1999-2009. While the propensity for foreign exchange intervention and exchange rate management among regional central banks remains fairly high in many cases and that the degree of fixity to the US dollar remains very strong, we note that these relationships correlate to some extent with the IMF exchange rate classifications. Specifically, we find that the inflation targeting countries exhibit less fixity and are less influenced by the US dollar than the non-inflation targeters.  We also find that the managed floaters (as defined by the IMF) exhibit less fixity and are less influenced by the US dollar than the conventional peggers.",F
"Scott W Hegerty","Capital flows to transition economies: what is the role of external shocks?","During the recent international financial crisis, capital flows into Central and Eastern European transition economies have faced a serious threat of a âsudden stop.â But the specific dangers depend on these flows` macroeconomic determinants, which can be ambiguous because the underlying savings and investment decisions can vary depending upon the persistence of income shocks. This study applies VAR methodologies to examine the relative influences of foreign and domestic income growth on the capital accounts of six countries that have recently joined the European Union. Impulse response functions show that Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, and Lithuania are influenced more strongly by foreign shocks, while Latvia, Estonia, and Romania show more of a response to domestic shocks. As a result, these three countriesâand Latvia in particularâshow a vulnerability to a sudden stop if they experience localized recessions.",F

In this study, we use 6 governance indicators, compiled by World Bank, to measure the change in China's institutional environment and to provide some empirical evidence of the linkage between the quality of governance and a firm's choice on entry mode. We determined that improved political stability, regulatory quality and rule of law would induce foreign firms entering China to be more willing to utilize a high-commitment entry mode, and thus, would result in more stable capital investment from foreign organizations.",F
"Wen-Shai  Hung","Survival Analysis for Unobserved Heterogeneity on Estimated Mortality in Taiwan","The purpose of this study provides evidences on the effects of unobserved heterogeneity on estimated mortality among the middle aged and elderly in Taiwan. The data used is from the Survey of Health and Living Status of the Middle Aged and Elderly in Taiwan (aged 50 to 66), and the mortality information was linked to 1996-2003 national death registry data. The Weibull models are used to estimate the effects of unobserved heterogeneity on mortality. Main empirical results confirm that, after considering unobserved heterogeneity, most estimated coefficients on the mortality regressors are larger in magnitude that the corresponding coefficients in the reference model. Especially, the terms of health care utilization have larger unobserved heterogenity on estimated mortality. Therefore, if the government policies can concern more unobserved heterogenity of health care utilization that might useful to decrease the mortality for the elderly.",I

By considering alternative approaches to further liberalising trade in three broadly defined sectors (agriculture, textiles and manufacturing), the paper establishes empirically the clear superiority of a comprehensive trade reform package which encompasses all sectors and geographic regions. Trade negotiators at the currently deadlocked Doha Round should take note of this result as a possible means of breaking the impasse.",F

The empirical findings reported in the paper reveal that savings and investment are nonstationary and cointegrated series. The estimated coefficients using DOLS is 0.58 for the sample as a whole for the period 1970-2006. However, there are marked differences in retentions ratios in each country group with ratio lowest in common law countries (0.34) compared to French civil law countries (0.85). These results imply that in the countries with strong legal protections of investors, capital tends to be mobile internationally than in countries with worse protection.",F

The empirical results substantiate  that a long-run level equilibrium  relationship exists among exports, output, terms of trade and labor productivity of the model  and that Granger causal flow between real exports and real output is reciprocal. Thus, our results attest to the advantage of the export-led growth strategy  for continuous growth in Taiwan.",F

We construct an econometric model then estimated with three-stage least squares (3SLS).  We then apply the movements of each explanatory variable over the period of investigation (POI) to its respective coefficient in order to determine how much injury is attributable to that particular market factor.  We find that subject and non-subject imports were essentially equal causes of injury to the domestic industry.",F

The empirical findings show that mobility of migrants between the host county (Russia) and home country (Tajikistan) is determined by age, employment before migration, and whether the migrant is the head of the household. Furthermore, the paper demonstrates that the longer the duration of migration, the higher the remittances and the larger the ratio of travel costs to income, the lower the remittances. This is because migrants increase the duration of emigration and avoid travel costs to increase remittances. However, migrants with higher monthly income have a lower ratio of travel costs to income and are likely to visit their families more often.",F

"EL FESSI BEN AMMAR  SANA","Exchange rate regimes and economic growth: an econometric investigation","The objective of this paper is to determine if the kind of exchange rate regime impacts the economic growth. The empiric analysis follows two phases:   At first, based on various de facto classifications reflexions and within suggestion logic, this works aims at setting a new de facto classification of a very big sample (that includes 181 IMF country member) of developed, emerging and developing countries. This classification takes into consideration both the benefits and drawbacks of subsequent de facto classifications.  Next, we've led an empiric study that aims at measuring empirically the impact of de facto change scheme obtained by our new classification method dealing with the economic growth. Our dynamic panel model takes into consideration specific effects, initial economic conditions, a number of control variables and binary variables relating to exchange rate regimes. The empirical analysis seems to show a link between the actual exchange rate regime and economic growth. In fact, the way to conduct the system plays an important role in the economy's growth for emerging and developing countries. Growth can display a high level with a fixed or intermediate regime. Moreover, the relationship between floating exchange rate and high growth is not robust even for developed countries.",F

The true burden of undiagnosed pre-diabetes is found to be considerably more than the numbers estimated by the American Diabetes Association. Men are found to be more likely to have undiagnosed pre-diabetes. Prevalence rates vary considerably between different racial,  gender, and age groups. There is no strong evidence that  systematic racial disparities exist. There is weak evidence that members of the minority communities may have slightly lower likelihood of suffering from undiagnosed prediabetes compared to non-Hispanic whites. This evidence is more pronounced for men than for women. Higher  prevalence of undiagnosed pre-diabetes among minorities especially in the early stages of lives may be partially responsible for overall racial disparities in diabetes in the country. Stopping 50% of the undiagnosed pre-diabetes cases from developing into diabetes will save US over $600 billion in current dollars.",I

Using 2001 National Health Interview Survey data for adult urban-US population, it is shown that individual health is better in bigger cities compared to small or medium sized ones. This result holds after controlling for potentially confounding variables including age, gender, education, marital status, smoking, income, asset-ownership, and race. Possible sources of selection bias are controlled using many model specifications and population sub-groupings. Although, stiff challenges for healthcare delivery exist for large cities, an aggressive urban health policy should also put strong emphasis on improving health in small and medium sized cities to reduce urban health disparities in the USA. Policy implications for other developed and developing countries are also hypothesized.",I

Using a non-parametric test for first order stochastic dominance it is shown that, in line with this hypothesis, the productivity distribution of firms with exports and R&D dominates that of exporters without R&D, which in turn dominates that of firms that neither export nor engage in R&D. These results are in line with findings for Argentina reported by Bustos, and with findings for Germany and Denmark. The model, therefore, seems to be useful to guide empirical work on the relation between exports, R&D and productivity.",F

The rich information contained in the dataset makes it possible to include both senders' and recipients' characteristics in the empirical model, which is not very common in much of the applied literature on remittances. Different motivations for tranfers seem to coexist: altruistic feelings certainly play an important role but at the same time remittances might be part of an implicit contract between the migrant and the family back home. In particular, the fact that the amount remitted rises with senders' education - even after controlling for migrants' income - may be supportive of the repayment hypothesis.",F

The relationship between REIT performance and house price or other financial variables represents important information for the risk management strategy of investors. Using a vector error correction model (VECM), the analysis found that in the long run, there exists a positive correlation between US equity REIT returns and house price. Our results reveal that if house prices in the US decline or the inflation index rises, the REIT performance will   in the long run. Our empirical results also indicate that in recent years, there appears to be a stronger positive correlation between US equity REIT returns and house price.",M
"Matthias  Busse","Foreign Direct Investment and Exchange Rate Regimes","The paper uses a comprehensive data set with bilateral direct investment flows and establishes the influence of the de-facto exchange rate regime for FDI flows. We find a strong and significant effect from fixed rates on bilateral FDI flows in developed economies, but no significant effect for developing countries. There is thus no general and uniform impact of stable exchange rates on FDI. We provide several possible explanations for this difference.",F

Sound recording piracy imposes significant costs on copyright owners, including record companies, music publishers, recording artists and songwriters. The contribution of this paper is the central role allocated to the affordability index (the ratio of legitimate price to average hourly earnings) and to the balance of trade in sound recording product. The estimated regression model identifies a positive and significant relationship between sound recording PMS and the price-earnings (PE) ratio.",F

"Mara  Grasseni","Multinational firms and FDI destinations: what explains the productivity gap?","This paper deals with the issue of the heterogeneity of productivity among three different groups of multinational firms according to where they invest. We use the procedure developed by Di Nardo et al (1996) and Melly (2005) to decompose the productivity gap across the entire productivity distribution in order to account for the relative importance of observed characteristics versus different returns. We find that the productivity gap suffered by firms that invest only in less developed countries is due to lower efficiency, not to worse characteristics. The most productive firms are those able to invest in both developed and less developed countries. They outperform firms investing only in one geographical area because of their better characteristics.",F

Most papers studying this question define regions according to normative criteria, even though this can lead to biased conclusions. In contrast, this article explores the per capita income (PCI) distribution of metropolitan regions defined by a functional criterion, the agglomerated population. Specifically, we examine the external shape and internal movements of the PCI distribution in a sample of 235 European metropolitan regions over the period 1995 to 2006. The results describe a process of income convergence among these regions.",R
"Joachim  Wagner","Low-productive exporters are high-quality exporters. Evidence from Germany","A stylized fact from the emerging literature on the micro-econometrics of international trade and a central implication of the heterogeneous firm models from the new new trade theory is that exporters are more productive than non-exporters. However, many firms from the lower end of the productivity distribution are exporters. Germany is a case in point. A recent study reports that these low-productivity exporters are not marginal exporters defined according to the share of exports in total sales, or export participation over time, or the number of goods exported, or the number of countries exported to. This paper documents that low-productive exporters are competitive because they export high-quality goods. The quality of exports is much higher among exporters from the lower end of the productivity distribution than among highly productive exporters.",F

This paper clarifies and calculates the concept of the equilibrium real exchange rate, using a structural vector autoregression (VAR) model. By imposing long-run restrictions on a VAR model for Venezuela, four structural shocks are identified: Nominal demand, real demand, supply and oil price shocks. The identified shocks and their impulse responses are consistent with an open economy model of economic fluctuations and highlight the role of the exchange rate in the transmission mechanism of an oil-producing country.",F

However, we argue that the relationship between the futures and spot prices with the conventional linear cointegration approach may not be appropriate after taking transaction costs into account. In this paper, an incorporation of transaction costs presented by Dumas (1992) and Michael (1997) into the exponential smooth transition autoregressive (ESTAR) model developed by Granger and Terasvita (1993) is motivated to examine the dynamic relationship between daily gold futures and spot prices and the nonlinear behavior of the gold futures basis. Transaction costs may lead to the existence of neutral band for futures market speculation within which profitable trading opportunities are impossible. Further, our results indicate that the ESTAR model provides higher forecasting power than the linear AR(1) model.",F

In this context, the main objective of this study is to analyze the international dairy trade in order to identify the comparative advantages of the Brazilian dairy products. In addition, we aimed to compare the comparative advantages of Brazil and the greatest players of the international dairy market. The results indicated that New Zealand presents the highest index of comparative advantage for dairy. Germany had more profits from the dairy exports in 2008, and still does not have major advantages compared to the other players. The United States, despite having the highest production of cow's milk and a large consumer market, has no comparative advantage. For its part, Argentina has a good comparative advantage index for total milk, but not so good for specific categories. Brazil, despite having relatively low rates, managed to expand its comparative advantage between 2000 and 2008, suggesting that the country has become more competitive in the international dairy market. However, considering other factors related to competitiveness, it is noted that the country needs to evolve to become a great player in the global market for dairy products.",F

We establish that the welfare superiority of the optimal subsidy or tariff depends on the relative steepness of the firms' common marginal cost curve: when it is relatively steep, tariffs are superior to subsidies in enhancing domestic welfare, and vice versa.  When both instruments are used simultaneously, the tariff component becomes more important as the marginal cost curve steepens.",F
"Sankar  Mukhopadhyay","Analyzing the impact of prenatal care on infant health:  do we have useful input and output measures?","Recent work raises questions about the input and output measures typically used to estimate the impact of prenatal care on infant health:  self-reported prenatal care may generate biased estimates of the impact of prenatal care on infant health, and birthweight may be a narrow measure of infant health that leads to underestimation of the impact of prenatal care on delivery outcomes. We link data from a prenatal care clinic, the associated hospital and the relevant birth certificate records to analyze these measurement issues.  We conclude that low birthweight is not meaningful measure of infant health for the purpose of estimating the relation between prenatal care and delivery outcomes.  In addition, the discrepancy between provider-reported and self-reported care is substantial, the correlation between these two measures is low, and the estimated relationship between prenatal care and infant health is not robust with respect to reliance on self-reported vs. provider-reported care.",I

The second aim of the paper is to study if the comparative advantage argument also explains the vertical intra-industry trade between different income countries. According to OLS estimations, technological differences increase DVIIT while physical capital differences lead to its decrease. The results obtained applying the Heckman method support the idea that differences in physical capital reduce the probability of IIT to occur but the level of vertical and horizontal IIT is more accurately explained by the proximity of partners, similarity in development level and size of market than by the differences in physical capital endowments. The variables considered, mostly country-specific, do have the same impact on vertical and horizontal IIT with emergent countries.",F

The results were as follows: (1) Co-movement is weaker for fluctuations with a duration of less than 3 years during the period from 1950-1990, with the exception of significantly positive co-movement with a duration of greater than 4 years during 1965-1975; and (2) positive long-term, mid-term, and short-term co-movement was indicated after 1990, among which positive short-term to short mid-term co-movement was the most significant.",F
"Joachim  Wagner","Do outliers and unobserved heterogeneity explain the exporter productivity premium? Evidence from France, Germany and the United Kingdom","A stylized fact from the literature on the Micro-econometrics of International Trade and a central implication of the heterogeneous firm models from the New New Trade Theory is that exporters are more productive than non-exporters. It is argued that this exporter productivity premium is due to extra costs of exporting that can be covered only by more productive firms. However, in recent papers that control for extreme observations and unobserved firm heterogeneity by applying a highly robust fixed-effects estimator, no such exporter productivity premium is found for firms from manufacturing and services industries in Germany. This paper uses enterprise level panel data for France, Germany and the United Kingdom from 2003 to 2008 to systematically investigate the role of outliers and unobserved firm heterogeneity for estimates of the exporter productivity premium. We report that outliers do have an influence on the estimated exporter productivity premium. We argue that the vanishing exporter premium in robust fixed effects estimations that is reported for all three countries is caused by characteristics of firms that start or stop to export over the period under investigation, and that are not representative for the bulk of firms that either export or not.",F

Regulatory environment and efficient and accountable government too are important. In contrast, infrastructure availability, current growth rates and occurrence of natural catastrophes do not appear to significantly influence FDI.

"Chien-Fu  Chen","Does PPP hold for Big Mac price or consumer price index? Evidence from panel cointegration","This paper examines the validity of purchasing power parity (PPP)  using CPI and Big Mac prices.  The benchmark model, i.e., the OLS  method, which does not take nonstationarity into account, rejects  the hypothesis of PPP regardless of prices used.  We next use the panel cointegration method to consider the nonstationary nature of variables. Estimated results for CPI are mixed.  The PPP is rejected when the nominal exchange rate is employed as the dependent variable but is not rejected when the price ratio is used as the dependent variable.  By contrast, the PPP is overwhelmingly not rejected when the Big Mac price is used.  Last, we remove the production bias and re-examine the same issue by using panel cointegration.  The PPP is again decisively rejected when CPI price is used but not for Big Mac price.  Accordingly, Big Mac price  is more supportive to the validity of PPP than CPI price.",F

More importantly, we reveal that the US GDP news has the strongest impact on both the first two moments of the Australian daily returns and help reduce volatility in the latter market.",F

In reality however, non-members do react to the creation of a trading bloc and relaxing this assumption can provide useful insights.  Using a political economy model, this paper explore the case where those excluded countries can adjust their commercial policies in order to minimize the negative effects of the PTA.  It is shown that the creation of a PTA can lead the excluded countries to increase their trade barriers with respect to the PTA members.",F

We examine the relationship between the U.S. trade balance and the G-7 countries' policy variables by constructing an eight-dimensional version of the structural vector autoregression (SVAR) model.  Our empirical results suggest that a reduction in the U.S. fiscal deficit is not such a reliable instrument for reducing the U.S. trade imbalance. Contrastingly, monetary tightening in the U.S. can reduce its trade deficit. Non-U.S. policy shocks are ineffective, while decline in the U.S. dollar plays an important role in reducing the U.S. trade deficit.",F

On the one hand, we show that public universities choose exams and zero fees under borrowing constraints because exams are efficient allocation devices, and the objective of public institutions is the maximization of surplus. On the other hand, private universities prefer the use of fees to guide admission policies since tuition fees are not only an allocation device but also a source of revenues. Interestingly, we find that while borrowing constraints do not affect quality and admission standards in the public university, they reduce both quality and fees in the private.",I

In other words, was the countries' debt sustainable, allowing an intervention through only an IMF bailout ? Using a non- parametric methodology (Classification And Regression Tree or CART), the fiscal and the external solvency of countries facing financial troubles since the 80's was assessed. It is found that, in some crisis episodes, like the one faced by Argentina in 1995, Brazil in 1999 and Turkey in 2001, a debt restructuring plan was necessary while the countries clearly exhibited solvency problems. This can explain the inefficiency of the IMF intervention during some crises.",F

In contrast to standard linear methods and studies which test for linearity only, we consider a novel approach that allows for the joint testing of nonlinearity and nonstationarity. Within this approach, we employ nonlinear threshold autoregressive (TAR) unit root tests to investigate whether the deviation of the nominal exchange rate from the level predicted by monetary fundamentals for three major currencies vis-Ã -vis the US dollar is mean reverting. We are able to reject the null hypotheses of linearity and nonstationarity indicating nonlinear mean reversion of the deviation of the exchange rate from monetary fundamentals. Further, large deviations are found to have faster speed of mean reversion than small deviations.",F

Evidence from Malaysia","For decades, the conventional wisdom for a developing nation striving to achieve an impressive economic growth has been to carve a niche in the global marketplace. However, empirical findings of various research studies on the âexport-led growthâ hypothesis do not provide a solid evidence to support this viewpoint. The current paper chooses one of the âEast Asian Miracleâ economies, Malaysia, to empirically examine whether exports act as the âengineâ of growth.  The results of the empirical analysis do not support the âexport-led growthâ hypothesis. Rather, they lead to a conclusion that there exists a âvirtuous cycleâ or mutually reinforcing relationship between Malaysia's exports and GDP in the long run. The findings also detected unidirectional short run causality from GDP to exports, but not vice versa. This means that the increase in Malaysia''s export tends to be an effect, and not the cause, of the country''s output expansion.",F

Objective of this study is to analyze the impact of the obligatory service requirement on specialist workforce distribution in public sector in Turkey, using a panel study with data from 63 provinces, in years 1990, 1995, and 2000. To identify the impact of the regulation we make use of the change in the regulation in 1995 which ended the requirement for the new graduates to work for 2 to 4 years in a location specified by the government. We test whether the importance of a socio-economic development index as a determinant of specialist distribution differs across the periods. We also provide summary statistics for the change in the workload of specialists. Results show that obligatory service requirements have been effective in directing specialist workforce to less developed parts of Turkey. When the requirement was lifted, socio-economic conditions of a region became a significant determinant of availability of specialists. Despite improvement in the specialist distribution, we observe no change in workload of specialists indicating a significant shortage.",I

Using quarterly data on ten countries over 1979-2011, the newly proposed statistical tests are supportive of a two-speed European Monetary Union, despite less asymmetric supply and demand shocks since 1999.",F
"Arshia  Amiri","HIV/AIDS-GDP Nexus? Evidence from panel-data for African countries","To test potential bilateral causalities relation between HIV-AIDS mortality and GDP, we propose a simple Granger noncausality test for heterogeneous panel data models. 44 African countries are selected for annual pooled data from 1990 to 2009. Results are presented for the heterogeneous noncausality hypothesis (HENC), which tests, for each cross-section unit, the nullity of all the coefficients of the lagged explanatory variable. Bilateral causality relation is observed for 5 countries out of 44 (11% of the countries in our data set). We have 18 countries of unidirectional causality, which 14 are from HIV mortality rate to GDP (43% from total), and 4 are from GDP to HIV mortality rate (9% from total). These results alert for the risk of epidemic trap, initiated first by the deleterious effect of HIV-Aids on countries income.",I

"Laudo M Ogura","What drove gentrification in Chicago community areas in the 2000s?","Gentrification can be defined as the process of upper income households settlement in poor neighborhoods. While the overall population in Chicago has gone down in the 2000s, some neighborhoods experienced a growth in their upper income population. This paper presents a study of factors associated with this growth, based on the analysis of data for the 77 community areas in Chicago.  Taking into account spatial dependence across areas, changes in the upper income population were found to be related to past population growth, youth, college attendance, employment opportunities, crime, and housing characteristics. Among the noticeable results were the negative effects of murder rates and the positive relation with the location of major public housing projects, which were renovated or demolished during the 1990s and 2000s.",R
"Kian-Ping  Lim","Income Disparity between Japan and ASEAN-5 Economies: Converge, Catching Up or Diverge?","The objective of this study is to empirically examine the income disparity between Japan and each of the five major economies of South East Asia (ASEAN-5) during the period of 1960 to 1997, utilizing the popular augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) unit root test. The results provide evidence of income divergence between Japan and each of the ASEAN-5 economies. To avoid the problem associated with structural break, this study proceeds with the jointly crash and changes in trend model proposed by Zivot and Andrews (1992), and is able to obtain evidence of long run income convergence between the Japanese and Singaporean economies. As for the rest of the four ASEAN countries- Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand, the earlier results of income divergence remain valid and hence suggest that it would be a more realistic and urgent goal to narrow the income gap among these five core economies of ASEAN.",F

Subject data were obtained from the National Health Interview Survey in Taiwan, a study conducted in 2009 that encompassed observations 65 years of age and older. Chi-square test and logistic regressions were used to determine the utilization of emergency medicine between the widowers and widows. Main empirical results confirmed that the life satisfaction, economic status, self-reported health, functional limitation, and stroke significantly associated with utilization of emergency medicine for both widowers and widows. Nevertheless, diabetes significantly raised the utilization of emergency medicine for widows but not for widowers. Moreover, widowers were more likely to use emergency medicine than widows. Finally, the utilization of emergency medicine was strongly correlated with predisposing, enabling and need characteristics among the elderly widowhood.",I

The focus of this pilot investigation is on the specific characteristics of municipalities located in the Emilia Romagna region over the period 2002-2007. A negative binomial estimation model is employed. It is found that the concentration of foreign economic activity is positively related to knowledge variables (i.e. R&D investments, the presence of a university and the presence of a district area) and productive structure variables (i.e. capital stock, labour cost and business services). Traditional infrastructural characteristics such as highways, railways and seaports, often regarded as important location determinants, are not robust with respect to the specification of the estimating equation.",F

"Jonathan  Munemo","Foreign Direct Investment, Business Start-up Regulations, and Entrepreneurship in Africa","This paper investigates how foreign direct investment (FDI) and its interaction with business start-up regulations affect entrepreneurship in a sample of African countries. Preliminary findings obtained from longitudinal data analysis suggest that the complementarity between FDI and entrepreneurship (measured by new business creation) significantly depends on the existing regulatory environment for business startups. More specifically, the results show that FDI significantly crowds-in new domestic firms when business start-up regulations are lower. In other words, excessive startup regulations are inefficient, and thus dissuade new firm creation by increasing the costs of doing business and impeding the crowding-in effect from FDI in domestic product and labor markets, as well as in foreign markets. From a policy standpoint, reforms to establish the level of regulation that is most beneficial for the successful entry of new local firms can therefore play a critical role in enhancing the complementarity between foreign and domestic enterprises. These reforms will not only increase the entry of new domestic firms, but will also generate positive externalities from FDI which arise from transmission of new ideas, entrepreneurial skills, and other knowledge transfers and lead to higher productivity and growth.",F

Based on its âgapâ specification and using two different detrending techniques, the results show that an inverse relationship between unemployment and output holds for most of the Spanish regions and for the whole country. However, the quantitative values of Okun''s coefficients for these regions are quite different. In addition, the coefficients for each region varied across the two detrending techniques. Even so, these coefficients are lower than those initially estimated by Okun and others.",R
"Roger  White","Is cultural distance a determinant of international migration flows? Evidence from Denmark, Germany, and the Netherlands","We examine the relationship between source-destination country cultural differences and international migration flows using data for three immigrant destination countries (i.e., Denmark, Germany, and the Netherlands) and a cohort of 66 heterogeneous immigrant source countries during the years 1997-2002. Results obtained from the estimation of our empirical specifications using the Negative Binomial regression technique indicate that, all else equal, cultural distance is negatively related to migration flows and that larger existing immigrant stocks correspond with larger subsequent migration flows. These findings are consistent with the results reported in Belot and Ederveen (2012). Extending the literature, we report that existing immigrant stocks act to offset the migration-inhibiting influences of cultural distance. Finally, we report variation across Denmark, Germany, and the Netherlands both in terms of the migration-inhibiting influence of cultural distance and in the extents to which existing immigrant stocks act to offset this influence.",F
"Jeng-Bau  Lin","Nonlinear Mean Reversion and Arbitrage in the Gold Futures Market","Previous literatures take transaction costs as being negligible when analyzing the futures basis behavior in linear dynamic framework. However, we argue that the relationship between the futures and spot prices with the conventional linear cointegration approach may not be appropriate after taking transaction costs into account. In this paper, an incorporation of transaction costs presented by Dumas (1992) and Michael (1997) into the exponential smooth transition autoregressive (ESTAR) model developed by Granger and Terasvita (1993) is motivated to examine the dynamic relationship between daily gold futures and spot prices and the nonlinear behavior of the gold futures basis. Transaction costs may lead to the existence of neutral band for futures market speculation within which profitable trading opportunities are impossible. Further, our results indicate that the ESTAR model provides higher forecasting power than the linear AR(1) model.",F

A Difference-in-Difference-in-Differences Approach","The effects of foreign aid on the endowment of recipient countries with infrastructure have received surprisingly little attention in the empirical literature. This paper addresses this question by performing difference-in-difference-in-differences estimations, with the treatment defined as steep increases in aid for infrastructure since a distinct change in donor behavior in 2005. Mitigating endogeneity concerns in this way, we consistently find aid for infrastructure to be ineffective in improving the recipient countries' endowment with infrastructure. This finding holds not only for an encompassing index of economic infrastructure, but also for sub-indices of infrastructure in transportation, communication, energy, and finance.",F

"Hisashi  Kurihara","Fragmentation in a product cycle model","We develop a simple model in which fragmentation, innovation and imitation take in place simultaneously. Firms in North fragment their business into two parts: assembly and services. A reduction in the cost of services to coordinate fragmented businesses between North and South does not enhance fragmentation. On the contrary, the arrival rate of imitation accelerates and that of innovation slows down. Consequently, the life of Northern goods becomes shorter and that of Southern copies becomes longer. We also derive other results to compare to those in Grossman and Helpman (1991) and in Glass and Saggi (2001).",F

The main finding is that as an effort becomes relatively more effective, the time share of the effort should increase and the time shares of the other efforts should decrease (i.e., one should adopt the strategy of playing to your strength) if the elasticity of substitution is larger than one. However, the exact opposite is true (i.e., one should adopt the strategy of overcoming your weakness) if the elasticity of substitution is smaller than one.",I

We confirm that the marginal cost of health supply decreases when the depreciation rate is an endogenous function of health investment and that the marginally reduced cost is greater for people in later life stages. We also find that the indirect channelâdepreciation rate reductionâis more effective for people in good health; however, the direct channelâthe classical Grossman modelâis more powerful for those in poor health. Our findings provide a more comprehensive view of the procedure for optimal health determination.",I
"Dan  Friesner","Ownership and rent-seeking behavior in specialty health care practices","Specialty health care practices are unique in that they exhibit a wide range of ownership types, from large corporations controlled by third parties to those directly owned by practitioners (physicians, therapists, etc.).  Many of these practices also employ licensed assistants whose labor is partially substitutable with those of the practitioners.  This paper presents a theoretical model that examines the impact that different levels of ownership have on rent-seeking behavior and efficiency within specialty practices.  Our primary focus is on whether lower levels of ownership induce practitioners to extract larger economic rents by substituting their services for those of their assistants.  We find that if the practitioners are not required to be technically efficient then they unambiguously respond to lower ownership with rent-seeking.  However, requiring the firm to be technically (but not allocatively) efficient, may be sufficient to mitigate this incentive.",I

However, relative PPP is not upheld with China (Mainland).",F
"Kazuhiro  Takauchi","Rules of origin and international R&D rivalry","We study a three-country three-firm free trade area (FTA) trade model with rules of origin (ROO) under international R&D competition. The external tariff is chosen by the country importing final goods in the FTA. If the FTA chooses a higher content rate of ROO, the country importing final goods chooses a higher tariff in order to compensate for lower consumer surplus. We have three results. First, if the FTA raises the content rate, it raises the costs of exporters within the area, but if the R&D cost is sufficiently low, the exporters actually increase exports and their profits also increase. Second, if the firms within the FTA are less efficient than outsiders, the social welfare of countries importing final goods is affected by the content rate in a U-shaped fashion. A tightening of ROO may reduce the social welfare of importing countries since it may replace productive firms outside the FTA with less productive local firms. Third, if the productivity within an FTA is relatively high, the optimal content rate of ROO for the importing country within the FTA is 100%. In that case, the country importing final goods does not need to rely on imports from outside. Since an increase in the content rate of ROO increases external tariff, the most stringent ROO requirement is desirable for that country.",F

Using an unbalanced panel dataset from 2005-09, our study shows no difference in the survival probability among exporters only, importers only, or two-way traders with non-traders. However, by digging deeper into export status, the results indicate that the probability of firm survival has a positive association with continuous exporters, but is negatively linked with export stoppers. Furthermore, our results also indicate that SMEs pursuing an indirect export mode exhibit a higher probability of survival than SMEs that export directly. These findings are robust to various econometric specifications.",F

"Matthew Cole","A note on bilateral trade agreements in the presence of irreversible investment and deferred negotiations","A common result in the trade literature is that a small country will realize gains from a bilateral free trade agreement with a large country. McLaren (1997) casts aspersions on this traditional belief by demonstrating that irreversible investment in the small country, with the possibility of re-negotiation by the large country, can actually make the small country prefer autarky to free trade. In this note, we identify a middle ground where the small country can realize above-autarky utility by only partially specializing (relative to the free-trade level of specialization) in export production  this improvement occurs even in the presence of irreversible investment and deferred negotiations.",F

Given such political difficulties, the London scheme seems to be very attractive.  In this paper, we develop a model that can expressly deal with the London-type revenue-recycling between congestion tax and investment in public transit, and analyze its effects.",R

When the marginal cost differential is âsignificantly large,â the home firm's ability to put the foreign firm at the risk of an AD violation is limited.  But when the marginal cost differential is âsignificantly small,â the home firm is able to increase its output and lower the price of the product below its normal value, putting the foreign firm in the situation of an illegal dumping.  One interesting implication is that, relative to the case without an AD law, the home firm has a stronger incentive to undertake cost-reducing activities (e.g., R&D investment or the adoption of a more efficient technology) under the law.",F

Because mean and variance do not exist for a distribution of QALY weights, using standard errors for statistical inference may lead to problems even when an approximation is used. In this paper, we verify the statistical properties of Groot's standard errors by simulation. We find that the corrected standard errors hold the same properties as a normal distribution under specific conditions. In general, however, it would be appropriate to use our simulation method to obtain critical values or p-value.",I

This situation has resulted in neglect of the effect of between-groups inequality which shows the disparity among groups. This paper aims to investigate both within- and between-group inequality, besides interpreting education inequality among individuals. Based on a case study in Sabah, Malaysia, this study measures education inequality through analysis of standard public examination results via the Theil index. Results show that education inequality in urban areas tends to be lesser than in rural areas, with students in the former showing better results in their examinations. It is noted that the overall level of education inequality as well as inequality for urban and rural areas in Sabah decreased between 2009 and 2013.

The grant provides an arguably exogenous increase in the number of AP courses offered in a school. Using an instrumental variable approach, this analysis shows that offering an additional AP course does not increase total enrollment in AP courses. Instead, students substitute out of other AP subjects to enroll in the new subject being offered. This result suggests that additional AP course access is unlikely to induce students to enroll in more AP courses.",I

If the crawl rate is sufficiently high (with respect to the drift), the crawling-band is similar to a free float regime. As the crawl rate decreases, the crawling-band system collapses to a standard target zone.",F

Full economic impacts of the agreement will not be known until 2020 when 99% of existing tariffs will be phased out in major markets among signatory nations. Using pre-agreement data, this research applies the natural trading partner hypothesis to make an ex-ante assessment of the agreement from New Zealand's perspective. Estimates of key indices show that the results are mixed and the overall welfare gains to New Zealand, if any, are likely to be small.",F
"Tony  Cavoli","A note on exchange rate regimes in Asia: Are they really what they claim to be?","This paper presents an analysis of the degree of de facto exchange rate flexibility in the exchange rate regimes for selected emerging Asian economies over the decade 1999-2009. While the propensity for foreign exchange intervention and exchange rate management among regional central banks remains fairly high in many cases and that the degree of fixity to the US dollar remains very strong, we note that these relationships correlate to some extent with the IMF exchange rate classifications. Specifically, we find that the inflation targeting countries exhibit less fixity and are less influenced by the US dollar than the non-inflation targeters.  We also find that the managed floaters (as defined by the IMF) exhibit less fixity and are less influenced by the US dollar than the conventional peggers.",F
"Scott W Hegerty","Capital flows to transition economies: what is the role of external shocks?","During the recent international financial crisis, capital flows into Central and Eastern European transition economies have faced a serious threat of a âsudden stop.â But the specific dangers depend on these flows` macroeconomic determinants, which can be ambiguous because the underlying savings and investment decisions can vary depending upon the persistence of income shocks. This study applies VAR methodologies to examine the relative influences of foreign and domestic income growth on the capital accounts of six countries that have recently joined the European Union. Impulse response functions show that Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, and Lithuania are influenced more strongly by foreign shocks, while Latvia, Estonia, and Romania show more of a response to domestic shocks. As a result, these three countriesâand Latvia in particularâshow a vulnerability to a sudden stop if they experience localized recessions.",F

In this study, we use 6 governance indicators, compiled by World Bank, to measure the change in China's institutional environment and to provide some empirical evidence of the linkage between the quality of governance and a firm's choice on entry mode. We determined that improved political stability, regulatory quality and rule of law would induce foreign firms entering China to be more willing to utilize a high-commitment entry mode, and thus, would result in more stable capital investment from foreign organizations.",F
"Wen-Shai  Hung","Survival Analysis for Unobserved Heterogeneity on Estimated Mortality in Taiwan","The purpose of this study provides evidences on the effects of unobserved heterogeneity on estimated mortality among the middle aged and elderly in Taiwan. The data used is from the Survey of Health and Living Status of the Middle Aged and Elderly in Taiwan (aged 50 to 66), and the mortality information was linked to 1996-2003 national death registry data. The Weibull models are used to estimate the effects of unobserved heterogeneity on mortality. Main empirical results confirm that, after considering unobserved heterogeneity, most estimated coefficients on the mortality regressors are larger in magnitude that the corresponding coefficients in the reference model. Especially, the terms of health care utilization have larger unobserved heterogenity on estimated mortality. Therefore, if the government policies can concern more unobserved heterogenity of health care utilization that might useful to decrease the mortality for the elderly.",I

By considering alternative approaches to further liberalising trade in three broadly defined sectors (agriculture, textiles and manufacturing), the paper establishes empirically the clear superiority of a comprehensive trade reform package which encompasses all sectors and geographic regions. Trade negotiators at the currently deadlocked Doha Round should take note of this result as a possible means of breaking the impasse.",F

The estimated coefficients using DOLS is 0.58 for the sample as a whole for the period 1970-2006. However, there are marked differences in retentions ratios in each country group with ratio lowest in common law countries (0.34) compared to French civil law countries (0.85).

We use both panel data and single country approach to the Granger non-causality testing. Results show that the relationship between change of child mortality rate and GDP per capita (GDPc) growth runs in both directions, in addition to large number of cases being from child mortality to economic growth. We find evidence that the causal effects of GDPc on child health outcomes are more frequent in low- and lower-middle-income countries relative to high- and upper-middle-income countries. However, in contrast, the causal effect of child mortality on GDPc is more often found in non-low-income countries.",I

Tuition fees for loss averse students","We model the educational choice of students whose objectives in terms of salary are conditioned by their social origins. We assume that students from a poor background have a lower reference point than students with wealthier origins. We then study the efficiency of a policy of tuition fees as a mechanism to select students on the basis of their academic abilities. We show that, even in the absence of borrowing constraints, the optimal policy consists in lowering tuition fees for poorer students: since prospective students from a disadvantaged background perceives the possibility of joining the university as a gain, they have a tendency to act too cautiously compared to students with higher aspirations, who are ready to take risky choices in order to avoid what they perceive as a failure, i.e. not joining the university.",I

We construct an econometric model then estimated with three-stage least squares (3SLS).  We then apply the movements of each explanatory variable over the period of investigation (POI) to its respective coefficient in order to determine how much injury is attributable to that particular market factor.  We find that subject and non-subject imports were essentially equal causes of injury to the domestic industry.",F

The empirical investigation finds that firms that imported in both 2009 and 2010 are much more important for the import dynamics than import starters and import stoppers. Firms that increased their imports (and that were the drivers of the import boom) imported on average more goods and from more countries of origin in 2009 than firms that decreased their imports, and they increased both extensive margins of imports on average while firms with decreased imports reduced both the number of goods imported and the number of countries of origin.",F
"Ha  Le","Multidimensional poverty: evidence from Vietnam","This study examines multidimensional poverty in Vietnam using the method of Alkire and Foster (2007, 2011) and household data from Vietnam Household Living Standard Surveys 2010 and 2012. The poverty is analyzed in five dimensions including health, education, insurance and social support, living condition, and social participation. The result shows that multidimensional poverty has decreased slightly during the 2010-2012 period. There is a large difference between multidimensional poverty and expenditure/income based poverty. While Northern Mountain is the poorest region in terms of income or expenditure, Mekong River Delta is the poorest region in terms of multidimensional poverty. The decomposition analysis shows that the ethnic minority group has a small proportion of population but contributes largely to the national multidimensional poverty. We also decompose the total multidimensional poverty into the contribution of five dimensions. We find that the deprivation of dimension âSocial insurance and social assistance' contributes the most to the total poverty, while the deprivation of dimension âLiving conditions' contributes the least to the total poverty.",I

"Cristina-Aurora, BUNEA-BONTAS","LEASE FINANCING: A NEW DUAL APPROACH","Leasing is an important additional financing technique used by many companies, enabling them to use property, plant and equipment without making large initial cash outlays. It also provides flexibility, allowing entities to address obsolescence risks. Under current accounting rules, when referring to the operating leasing in particular, there is a lack of comparability between the financial position and operating results of companies that buy assets and the financial position and operating results of those that lease similar assets. This has led critics to assert that the current accounting does not portray the economics of lease arrangements. In response to this criticism, the IASB and FASB have developed a new approach to lease accounting that would require a lessee to recognise assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by leases, this providing greater transparency and comparability for financial statements users. On the other hand, the proposals will affect almost every company and the impact of the proposed changes may be significant, as recognising additional assets and liabilities and finance expense will affect key performance ratios and, consequently, the ability to satisfy debt covenants.",M

In relation to the content of the human resource management, we consider it useful to note three important features of this work: human resource management is action-oriented, human resource management is individual-oriented; human resource management is future-oriented. All these guidelines reflect the fact that vision related to the enterprise's staff has changed as a result of changes in the economic, social, psychological and ethnic context. This research has applications in the field of hotel management companies. Study results indicate that organizational culture is a significant predictor of organizational performance, due to the fact that a satisfied employee will be efficient at his/her job, as well as for the methods and techniques used in the human resource management. In a market economy, the enterprise operates under the conditions of a strong competition, both on domestic and foreign markets. Therefore, in order to have a profitable business, there is a need to create structures capable to anticipate the evolution trend, as well as structured and content changes on the market it operates.

As regards adjustments for impairment, at first sight they are similar to cases of asset devaluation. Although the final effect is the same, reducing the value of assets, the devaluation according to IFRS refers to damage with few chances of disappearing in the future, whereas adjustments for impairment in the sense of Ordinance of the Public Finance Minister 1802/2014 envisage a reversible impairment.",M

In fact, time is one component of the total cost that the customer bears and cost is a core component of the perceived cost-benefit equation that the customer uses to evaluate her or his sustained patronage of a particular service. In most services, customers consider waiting as a waste of time. However, from the customer perspective, in the case of a full-service restaurant, waiting is expected and sometimes desirable also. Prior research, mainly in the west, suggests that when customers think that a wait for service is too long, they become less satisfied with overall service quality. Based on a research setting in a full-scale restaurant in India, this paper seeks answers to two research questions: First, what are the determinants of overall waiting-time satisfaction and second, what is the influence of waiting-time satisfaction on customer loyalty.",M

The Venture Capital (VC) firms can choose between three outcomes: the company exits from their portfolios by success ? IPO or acquisition on favourable termsÂ ?, exits by failure ? closing down or distress sale ? or remains in their portfolios. We model the probability that a company exits with success (failure) versus remains in the portfolios. We investigate two areas of research: the learning-by-doing models in business demography and the venture capital literature, studying the effectiveness of gradual investment and syndication practices based on the agency theory and the resource-based theory. We assume that either the passive or the active learning-by-doing model may highlight the dynamics of companies and we consider that the efficiency of VC firms at promoting their portfolio companies? potential relies on the multi-stage investment vehicle and syndicate relationships with partners VCs. Our econometrical results support the active learning hypothesis: reducing the time it takes to gather valuable information on the venture, by increasing the number of financial rounds, increases the likelihood of the company exiting from the VC firm?s portfolio, regardless of the exit mode. We also find that the active learning process is oriented towards the less promising companies: VC firms monitor more those companies with a higher probability of exit with failure. Syndication has no significant effect. These two last results orient towards the dark sides of the staged financing and syndication. JEL Classification: G24 G33 L25 M13",M

Investigations sur base de la courbe du ROC","The practical utility of the non monetary approaches of poverty is assessed on the basis of the study of the overlap between income and direct outcome measures of poverty. The use of the graphic method of the curve of the Receiver Operating Characteristics allows, contrary to the approach traditionally used, to assess the degree of overlap independently of the threshold of deprivation. The application of this methodology to the data of the European Community Household Panel shows a significant discrepancy between these approaches, hence advocating for a complementary, rather than substitutable, use of these approaches and for further research on the methods of measurement of multidimensional poverty.

Dispersion in a Monetary Union","Using a two&#8211;country DGSE combining nominal rigidities and financial frictions, we show that the persistence of output and inflation asymmetries observed since 1999 in an increasingly integrated EMU is not necessarily puzzling. Only the integration of intermediate goods markets unambiguously leads to a reduction of asymmetries while the integration of finals goods markets and the integration of financial markets increase the dispersion of inflation rates and business cycles. The result builds on the intensive use of financial markets, i.e. the current account, to adjust externally and smooth the consequences of asymmetric shocks. This mechanism implies a disconnection of country&#8211;level outputs and/or inflation rates to ensure that agents return to their initial asset position in the long run.

The main effect of the crisis, a general distrust of all the countries of Europe about England, is difficult to understand too. The idea exposed in this paper is that the crisis of 1866 was provoked by the deregulation of 1862, which allowed every company to register under the limited liability principle. This act deeply changed the behavior of the entrepreneurs. This change led to the appearance of a systemic risk in the banking sector.

Once Malaysia imposed comprehensive restraints in 1998, it was clear that the option of controls could no longer be excluded from the policy agenda. At the same time, reconsiderations of both theory and history cast the case for restraints in a new and more positive light. Four possible explanations are explored. Little evidence exists to suggest that governments hesitate because of concerns for technical issues, lack of convincing evidence, or ideological principle.

Moreover, the system blends retrospective and prospective elements which limit the incentive to reduce unit costs. Altogether, the French model is closer to regulation with fixed rates under planning constraints than to the initial yardstick competition model that was implemented by Medicare in the usa.

The first is the product oriented or service oriented innovation processes of large firms. The second is the distance between the core technological fields of large firms and start-up. Based on these two factors we propose a categorization of start-ups contests in four types: early co-development, co-development close to market, acceleration and outsourcing. The cases we study show the strong influence of the technologies linked to Internet in the development of the start-ups contests.

Empirical studies show that a PWYW pricing mechanism is able to increase a seller?s turnover and profit. This paper addresses PWYW pricing for bundles of experience goods. The paper shows that a PWYW pricing mechanism, if applied to ex post consumption, separates the decision to buy from the decision how much to pay. Information asymmetries about the quality of the good are reduced during the act of consumption so that buyers are informed about the product?s quality when they decide how much to pay. As a consequence, risk-averse buyers who would otherwise refrain from purchasing under a fixed price mechanism can be attracted to purchase under a PWYW pricing ex post consumption (PWYW-EPC) mechanism. In this case, the pricing mechanism itself constitutes a signal. The paper concludes that a PWYW pricing mechanism, applied to ex post consumption, can be a profitable strategy for a seller if she sells bundles of experience goods and if she wants to attract risk-averse buyers for realizing economies of scale in production.

Securing the recruitment of scientific manpower and transmitting a scientific culture is a double aim that has justified scientific teaching for several decades. In this article, the author studies the recent reformulation of this double aim. To do so, the author focuses on the European discourse on education and scientific teaching in a first part, and, in a second part, studies how educational materials such as textbooks echo this discourse<np pagenum=112/> in three different national contexts. This analysis shows that science remains introduced as a favored activity and way of thinking.

That raises the question of the transmission of technical knowledge to different audiences, as well as the issue of knowledge legitimization. At the Conservatoire, thanks to the system of chairs, knowledge is constructed not in regards to academic disciplines, but according to know-how. Two sorts of audiences were progressively distinguished. On the<np pagenum=140/> one hand, an audience composed of training professionals; in this case, knowledge is legitimate since it allows the trainee to be an efficient worker. On the other hand, the general public, for whom are set up public conferences and the Museum of Arts and Crafts; in this case, knowledge is legitimate because it educates the audience.

They do not take into account more than their predecessors that the French secondary education system creates a students? categorization in terms of recognition as ?scientific? with the ?Bac S?, a key diploma allowing each year only a quarter of each generation to be later considered as ?scientists?. CSTI for adults should therefore be separated in two families: the first organizing the dialogue between scientists and ?laymen? without questioning this divide and the second fostering the appropriation of knowledge in order to transgress this scientific school divide. However, it is not the case, the field of CSTI continuing to be only a patchwork of various actions with disparate social aims. Moreover, the multiplication of actors focused on very specific objectives ??such as promoting local innovation networks?? makes more than ever difficult to identify bad sociocultural effects at a nationwide scale.

It makes usual trade statistics misleading as a measure of the contribution of each industry and each country to the international division of labour. This paper uses input-output tables and trade tables from the GTAP database to compute trade statistics in value-added. It does that by excluding vertical trade and dispatching the value-added incorporated in other trade flows to their proper industry and country. In 2001, 28% of world trade and 29% of French trade were vertical trade. The method does not change the geography of trade much. It changes the relative involvement of different industries, as industrial trade flows incorporate important service inputs. Business services, trade, communication and transport have a more important positive contribution to the French trade balance than the usual data suggest. JEL Code: F19.",F

It relies on studies focussed on the interactions between teachers and pupils and between pupils themselves, and also those, less numerous, which compare single-sex and coeducational classes. It questions the impact of that way of operating upon pupils, with respect to the interpretations of social psychologists: actually, it proves that facing the ?other? increases the strength of the gender stereotypes, especially regarding self-confidence. In a last part, the text introduces a more normative debate upon the educational policies concerning co-education, since the latter does result, in spite of its obvious aspect, in ambivalent effects and seems to generate what would be a performative discrimination. The debate, which leads to discuss the question of coming back to single-sex classes ? even in a limited manner ? keeps quite open; that is because it relies in fine on conceptions of masculinity and femininity and on what equality means, which remains to day far from a consensual issue.

French mark-ups are contra-cyclical and depend upon openness to international trade, industry concentration.

"Schweizer, T.S.","Managing interactions between technological and stylistic innovation in the media industries, insights from the introduction of ebook technology in the publishing industry","The mainstream of innovation research pays a lot of attention to technological innovation, but has neglected its interaction with another type of innovation, which is particularly important in sectors like the furniture, fashion and the media content industries: stylistic innovation. This paper explains how the quality certification processes for technological and stylistic innovations differ and how they may interact in the media industries. Awards are discussed as specific instantiations of micro certification schemes indicating excellence with respect to stylistic and/or technological product features. Furthermore, a definition of stylistic innovation is developed with reference to organizational identity as well as reputation, two key concepts, which permeate the processes of innovation and certification discussed in this paper. Stylistic and technological innovation may take place in both, the content as well as the form of media products. It will be argued that the interaction between stylistic and technological innovation depends, first of all, on the location of each of these types of innovation within the product, and, secondly, on the characteristics of the certification scheme faced by the producing firms. Within the media sector the literary publishing industry has been chosen to provide the subject of the empirical part. Two case studies related to the introduction of eBook technology are presented: One is a study of the first digital literary publisher in Europe and the other is a case study of the first international eBook award, which mixes technological and stylistic criteria. Theory and cases lead to a number of hypotheses, which are offered as potential departure points for future research on the interaction between innovation in style and technology.",M

However, this has had only very little impact on the design of management accounting and control systems in organizations. Consequently, management accounting is (again) at risk of becoming irrelevant. To secure its relevance, management accountants need to become aware of their role as choice architects and need to develop into professionals whose core competence is to provide insight into quantitative information as a product of human decision making and, vice versa, to explain and predict decision-making behavior as a response to quantitative information. Academic management accounting research should facilitate this development.

We focus on the trade of the EU-27 as a group, but we stress the differences and similarities between the old member states (EU-15) and the new member states (NMS) as well. Structured in seven parts, the paper reveals several noteworthy conclusions. Firstly, the EU remains the world trade leader; nevertheless, its market shares have been diminishing in the recent years, both in the export and import flows, due to a complex of factors. Secondly, the NMS shares in the EU trade flows have been growing; yet, the NMS shares in the exports and imports of the EU-27 remain at a very low level. Besides, the normalized trade balance of the NSM, compared with that of the EU-15 underlines the different competitive advantages of the two groups. Thirdly, the trade deficit of the EU-27 continues to deepen (the extra-EU trade deficit tripled in 2004-2008); however, there are significant differences between the manufactures trade balance (with large surpluses) and the commodities trade balance (with a deficit that doubled between 2004 and 2008). Fourth, the paper points out that the extra-EU exports and the imports are dominated by the manufactures; however the share of manufactures in the import flows is much smaller than that in the export flows. Finally, the present analysis traces evidence of the major impact of the global financial and economic crisis on the EU trade flows and the first signs of recovery.",F

European Union and its Member States (Romania inclusive) position on international HT market defines in fact their competitivity in the global economy. Many politics for encourage innovation in a country lead also to stimulate the technological transfer out of that country. Politics that reduce trade barriers and uncertainties in international trade relations have the potential to increase the international technology transfer. The weight of HT products and services in the entire world trade is around of 19-20%, this percentage varying in different studies and statistics due to the products groups considered to be part of this category and to the inclusion of some adjacent services. During 2001-2008, the world HT export value increased in average by 7% per year. The growth rates were fairly high, by one hand, because of the rising of exported/imported products complexity (and of advanced technologies), and by the other hand, due to the evolution of global demand and offer, that influence the prices of these products. The Popular Republic of China was the country that influenced mostly the increase of international trade with HT products. Four economies â China, United States, EU â 27 and Japan â totalize over one half of the world HT exports. USA and EU registered also the most important commercial deficits in the world in this field until 2008. In 2008, USA deficit turns into commercial surplus in HT area because of the decrease of imports following the crisis. As for Romania, the weight of HT products exports and imports in the whole countryâs trade differs from about 4%, in exports case, to about 9-10%, in that of imports. Commercial balance in this field was always in the red. During 2001-2008, the greatest weights in the world trade with HT products have had, in order, the groups: electronics â telecommunications, computers - office equipment, scientific instruments and aerospace industry that summarized over 80% from the total. Generally, exports of less sophisticated HT products are dominated by developing countries and other territories because of the production relocation made by great international companies. Instead of it, the maintaining of developed states in top of the leading exporters of sophisticated HT products highlighted that not all the advanced technologies were transferred to developing countries, but, in general, those technologies less complex, which does not require a major investing effort in research and development.",F

The paper analyses the difficulty of choosing among different categories of applicants in the context of entrance quotas pertaining to the level of higher education (college, university) from which one applies to medical school. We use a sequential probit model to show that the performance variables, as measured or observed by the admissions committee through a variety of tests, only partially explain the committee's decisions.

By extending the previous sample of 1983-87 to 1983-90, by adding the permanent disabilities as a new dependent variable, and by re-estimating the same relations in risky industries only, this study shows that, at best, certain preventive measures adopted by the CSST led to a minor reduction in the frequency of accidents during this period. The0501n results of this research are the increasing impact, in comparison with 1987, of intervention measures (compensation and experience rating) of CSST on the frequency and severity of accidents in all industries, the more pronounced effect of inspections on the frequency of accidents in risky sectors, and the mediocre performance of CSST measures in preventing accidents with permanent disabilities.

Gains to free bilateral trade are estimated to be negligible for the big economy, Europe, but significant for the small one, Canada. The pattern of comparative advantage persists when we allowfor free access to technology and consumption coefficients and, therefore, can be ascribed to the endowments.

We allow for both homogenous and heterogeneous treatment effects, to highlight the mechanisms through which the contract teacher effect works.

However, teachers. classroom practices and the teaching .process. may matter more to student learning than teachers. observed résumé characteristics (such as certification and experience). There may also be important differences in teacher characteristics across government and private schools which may help explain the large documented public-private achievement differences often found in studies. This paper delves into the black-box representing .teaching. to uncover the teacher characteristics and teaching practices that matter most to pupil achievement. This is done using unique, school-based data, collected in 2002-2003 from government and private schools from one district in Punjab province in Pakistan. The data allow exploitation of an identification strategy that permits the matching of students. test scores in language and mathematics to the characteristics of teachers that teach those subjects. Within pupil (across subject rather than across time) variation is used to examine whether the characteristics of different subject teachers are related to a students. mark across subjects. The data is also unique in asking all subject teachers questions pertaining to their teaching practices and these, often unobserved, process variables are included in achievement function estimates. Our pupil fixed-effects findings reveal that the standard résumé characteristics of teachers do not significantly matter to pupil achievement. Perversely, however, teachers are found to be rewarded for possessing these characteristics highlighting the highly inefficient nature of teacher pay schedules. Our findings also show that teaching process variables matter significantly to student achievement. There are important differences across school-types.",I

International retrospective empirical studies suggest that home heating is associated with asthma rates. However, strong evid¬ence of causality is lacking. In this paper, we empirically investigate the link between home heating and hospital asthma admissions in New Zealand using panel data techniques and controlling for endogeneity. The hypothesis that higher electricity prices (via less adequate heating) increase hospital asthma admissions is tested and receives strong empirical support across a number of model specifications and datasets used.",I

Numerous calls have been made for accounting educators to adopt strategies that produce such results. This paper reports on changes to the learning environment centring on the introduction of group learning activities that were designed to improve the quality of students' learning outcomes. The impact of changes in the learning environment on students' approaches to learning, as measured by the Study Process Questionnaire (SPQ) (Biggs, 1987b), was then assessed. Results indicate that, across the semester, accounting students exhibited a small but statistically significant increase in their deep learning approach, and a small but statistically significant reduction in their surface learning approach. The results suggest that accounting educators, through changes in the learning environment, may be able to influence the learning approaches adopted by accounting students.",M
"Andrea Mennicken","Translation and standardisation: audit world building in Post-Soviet Russia","Within the past thirty years or so, the government of social and economic life has occurred increasingly through international and non-governmental forms of rule and regulation. Yet little is known about the dynamics that international audit standardization projects create below the global level of economic and regulatory activity. This paper examines effects of global audit rule-setting on local organizational forms and practices through a detailed empirical investigation of the use and circulation of International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) within a large post-Soviet Russian audit firm. In the firm studied, much of the appeal of the ISAs was rooted in desires to develop an internationally-oriented business strategy as well as link up with Western audit markets. But the standards became embedded in locally partitioned hierarchies of expertise and credibility. On the one hand, the global aspirations of the firm continued to be couched in former socialist practices of command and control. On the other hand, the accomplishment of compliance with the international standards came to be highly dependent on the definitional powers of the West, represented by the big international audit firms and multilateral organisations, such as the World Bank or the EBRD. The ISAs turned out to be of lower status than the names of the international audit firms and their networks. Becoming defined as working in accordance with international standards became closely linked to the firmâs ability to position itself, and the standards respectively, within one of these networks. The paper examines the transformations that the firm underwent in re-defining itself in terms of a globally-oriented business strategy and discusses the implications this had for the roles and relevance of the international auditing standards.",M
"Barbara Petrongolo|Christopher Pissarides","The ins and outs of European unemployment","In this paper we study the contribution of inflows and outflows to the dynamics of unemployment in three European countries, the United Kingdom, France and Spain. All countries are interesting in their own right and in the comparison with each other. Britainâs labour markets were strictly regulated up to the mid 1980s but they have been liberalized since then. France is still a regulated economy compared with Britain, with unemployment averaging about 8%. Spain has had the biggest rise in unemployment in Europe, reaching 24% in the mid 1990s, but policy reforms and fast growth since then brought it down to a level below Franceâs. We compare performance in these three countries making use of both administrative and labor force survey data. We find that the impact of the 1980s reforms in Britain is evident in the contributions of the inflow and outflow rates. The inflow rate became a bigger contributor after the mid 1980s, although its significance subsided again in the late 1990s and 2000s. In France the dynamics of unemployment are driven by the outflow rate virtually entirely, which is consistent with a regime with strict employment protection legislation. In Spain, however, both rates contribute significantly to the dynamics, perhaps as a consequence of the prominence of fixed-term contracts since the late 1980s.",I

The first attempt to do this in the UK was made by Tibor Barna for the year 1937. Subsequently his approach has been replicated and elaborated. This study reworks and compares data from various studies to see how the scale and nature of the stateâs redistributive role has changed over the past seventy years. Differences in methods and data make comparisons difficult but some broad conclusions can be drawn. Some methodological issues are also discussed on the question of how to approach household equivalisation when services in kind are treated as income.",I
"John Hills","Following or leading public opinion? Social security policy and public attitudes since 1997","This paper examines New Labour's social security and related policies since 1997 in the light of evidence on public attitudes. The list of measures where policies have been in or have come into line with public attitudes is much longer than the list of measures where policies have been out of line with public attitudes or appear to have led them. One interpretation is that policy has been led by opinion surveys and focus groups, with opportunities lost to take more radical action and then persuade people of the need and justification for it. An alternative would be that policy has navigated with the grain of some of the more progressive parts of public opinion to achieve a result that has carried the public with it, in a way that would not have been sustainable if there had simply been an increase in the generosity of an unreformed social security system.",I
"Julian Le Grand","Individual choice and social exclusion","Why is social exclusion a problem? What about âvoluntaryâ social exclusion â when an individual chooses to exclude him or herself from the wider society? Brain Barry has addressed these questions in a recent CASE book, arguing that social exclusion, voluntary or involuntary, offends against social justice and social solidarity. This paper contends that Barryâs arguments are weak for voluntary social exclusion and argues that, perhaps surprisingly, a better case can be made for treating voluntary social exclusion as a problem on welfarist grounds.",I
"Julian Le Grand|Liz Richardson","Outsider and insider expertise: the response of residents of deprived neighbourhoods to an academic definition of social exclusion","The aim of this paper is to compare academic interpretations of the term social exclusion with the understanding of people with direct experience of the phenomenon. A pre-selected group of residents of deprived neighbourhoods were asked about various aspects of the concept and their responses compared with the definitions of social exclusion used by Burchardt, Le Grand and Piachaud in their 1999 article in the journal Social Policy and Administration. In general, the residentsâ understanding of the term corresponded well with the more academic definitions; however, in one or two key areas there were significant differences, for example, the importance of neighbourhood and âservice povertyâ, and the need for action against aspects of social exclusion on the grounds of social justice. This confirms that it might be useful for more academic concepts to be tested against the views of those with experience of the phenomenon which the concept is trying to capture.",I
"Bernardo Guimaraes","Vulnerability of currency pegs: evidence from Brazil","This paper analyses predictions of a simple model of currency crises in which the peg will be abandoned when the currency overvaluation hits a certain threshold, unknown to the agents. Due to learning about the threshold, some features usually observed in the data and identified with models with multiple equilibria arise in the model. But the model yields distinctive predictions about the behaviour of the probability and the expected magnitude of a currency devaluation. The paper identifies the probability and expected magnitude of a devaluation of Brazilian Real in the period leading up to the end of the Brazilian pegged exchange rate regime, using data on exchange rate options. The empirical results are consistent with model predictions.",F

What lessons should the UK draw from US experience? The long established means tested programme for needy families known as Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) was replaced in 1996 with a welfare to work programme known as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF). The historical background and features of the new program are elaborated and the way it has been implemented in varied ways in different states is documented.

Family incomes have increased, children lead more solitary lives, attitudes to childhood have changed, new products have been developed and commercial pressures on children have increased. The importance of these commercial pressures is analysed. Do children understand advertising? How is child poverty affected? How does increased materialism affect psychological well-being? The issues raised for public policy are discussed in terms of childrenâs freedom, the rights of children and the protection of children. Finally, the future of childhood is considered and choices between constraining commercial pressures or not are considered.",I
"Carol Propper|John A. Rigg","Socio-economic status and child behaviour: evidence from a contemporary UK cohort","This paper examines whether and how socio-economic status is associated with childrenâs behavioural development in todayâs children. Using a large cohort of English children born in the early 1990s we find significant social inequalities in several dimensions of child behaviour at age 7. We examine whether these inequalities are associated with characteristics of the childâs early home environment and parental behaviours. These include the material quality of the childâs home, maternal mental health, parental conflict and child diet. Most of these factors are socially graded and so could potentially account for the gradient in behaviours, but none singly account for a large part of the gradient in behavioural outcomes. However, taken together, these differences in the home environment can explain up to half the social gradients in child behaviours.",I
"Tom Sefton","Using the British Household Panel Survey to explore changes in housing tenure in England","Very little information exists about householdsâ longer-term movements between tenures. Some cross-section datasets include information on length of stay in any residence but we have no systematic study of movement over time. This study uses the British Household Panel Study to examine movements by households over a ten-year period â 1994/5 and 2004/5. Changes in tenure are related to key life events â leaving home, marriage, having children, widowhood and retirement. The great majority of owner-occupiers remained in that tenure. This was somewhat less for those experiencing divorce or unemployment. Most public housing tenants remained in that tenure over the ten-year period especially the elderly and the unemployed or those outside the labour market. About a quarter moved into owner-occupation and half of those through the right to buy their dwelling. The analysis looks at the associations between moving into work and residential mobility, in particular the slower rate at which social tenants move back into employment.",R
"Carol Propper|John A. Rigg","Understanding socio-economic inequalities in childhood respiratory health","Asthma is the most common chronic disease of childhood. Recent evidence has shown a socio-economic gradient in its distribution. This paper examines whether a number of factors argued to have led to a rise in the incidence of asthma might also explain the social gradient. Several of these have been the object of policy intervention, though not necessarily with the aim of lowering childhood respiratory conditions. Using a large cohort study (the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children) we find significant inequalities in three respiratory conditions in middle childhood. We investigate eight potential mediating factors: exposure to other children in infancy, childâs diet, poor housing conditions, maternal smoking, parental history of asthma, poor child health at birth, maternal age at childâs birth and local deprivation. We find that each of these alone typically explains a relatively modest part of each respiratory inequality, with childâs diet, local deprivation and maternal smoking generally the most important. But taken together, the mediating factors account for a substantial part of the respiratory inequalities. So the socio-economic gradient appears to operate through a number of inter-correlated pathways, some of which may be amenable to policy intervention.",I
"Lucinda Platt","Assessing the impact of illness, caring and ethnicity on social activity","It has long been accepted that lack of social participation in wider society is one aspect or one definition of poverty. Current concerns with the extent and distribution of social capital as both a measure of a good society and as means to upward mobility also emphasise the importance of social contacts and networks to the well-being of individuals and communities. While research has often focused on âcivic participationâ and the measurement of trust, more informal social bonds are also a crucial part of individualsâ social capital. Moreover, informal social capital or social participation might be particularly important for those whose circumstances make them already more vulnerable to marginalisation, exclusion or poverty. For example, social interaction has been argued to be conducive to better outcomes for those with health problems; and there is an extensive literature which aims to chart and explain the role of âethnic capitalâ in the life chances of minority ethnic groups. I use the British Home Office Citizenship Survey 2001 for England and Wales to explore the impact on four aspects of lack of social engagement of long-term illness, caring for someone with such an illness, and ethnicity. Controlling for a range of characteristics and examining the relationships separately for men and women there is evidence that between them, the four measures reveal an underlying propensity for reduced social contact. Other things being equal, illness has little association with reduced social participation, but caring does seem to affect opportunities for sociability. Members of some ethnic groups are less likely to engage in neighbourly social visiting than others, and these differences are little affected by income level. By contrast differences in âgoing outâ across groups can largely be explained by differences in income. Overall, social engagement among male Bangladeshis and to a lesser extent Pakistanis is high, whereas Black Africans and Black Caribbeans, especially women, are notable for their lack of opportunities for social engagement compared with their otherwise similar peers. They would appear to be particularly at risk of social isolation, with consequences for their current and future welfare.",I
"Eleni Karagiannaki","Exploring the effects of integrated benefit systems and active labour market policies: evidence from Jobcentre Plus in the UK","In April 2002 Jobcentre Plus started to operate in the UK bringing together the service of the Benefits Agency and the Employment Service. Offering a fully integrated benefit claiming and work placement/job-seeking service for people of working age this new organisation aims to strengthen the link between welfare and work. Due to the magnitude of the associated organisational change, the national roll-out of the new organisation is being implemented gradually over a transitional period ending in 2006. During this transitional period some local offices are fully integrated while others functions remain split between pre-existing Benefits Agency and Employment Service offices. In this paper we examine how changes in the level of integration (measured as the percentage of offices within districts offering the integrated Jobcentre Plus service) within districts over time affected performance with respect to job entry, benefit service and customer service delivery. Our analysis suggests that Jobcentre Plus has a clear positive effect on job entry outcomes for all client groups, a negative effect on business delivery while it has neither a positive nor a negative effect on customer service outcomes.",I
"Arnstein Aassve|Simon Burgess|Matt Dickson|Carol Propper","Modelling poverty by not modelling poverty: an application of a simultaneous hazards approach to the UK","We pursue an economic approach to analysing poverty. This requires a focus on the variables that individuals can influence, such as forming or dissolving a union or having children. We argue that this indirect approach to modelling poverty is the right way to bring economic tools to bear on the issue. In our implementation of this approach, we focus on endogenous demographic and employment transitions as the driving forces behind changes in poverty. We construct a dataset covering event histories over a long window and estimate five simultaneous hazards with unrestricted correlated heterogeneity. The model fits the demographic and poverty data reasonably well. We investigate the important parameters and processes for differences in individualsâ poverty likelihood. Employment, and particularly employment of disadvantaged women with children, is important.",I
"Carol Propper|John A. Rigg|Simon Burgess","Health supplier quality and the distribution of child health","There is emerging evidence to suggest that initial differentials between the health of poor and more affluent children in the UK do not widen over early childhood. One reason may be that through the universal public funded health care system all children have access to equally effective primary care providers. This paper examines this explanation. The analysis has two components. It first examines whether children from poorer families have access to general practitioners of a similar quality to children from richer families. It then examines whether the quality of primary care to which a child has access has an impact on their health at birth and on their health during early childhood. The results suggest that children from poor families do not have access to markedly worse quality primary care, and further, that the quality of primary care does not appear to have a large effect on differentials in child health in early childhood.

"Alan Hedges","Perceptions of redistribution: report on exploratory qualitative research","This paper represents the results of a small-scale qualitative study, exploring public perceptions of the redistributive effects of taxation and public spending in the UK. Redistribution is not at the top of peopleâs minds when they consider these issues and it is a complex subject on which they have thought little. People appear to apply separate principles of âfairnessâ and âmutualityâ to the structures of taxation and public spending. Fairness in taxation may involve more progressivity than the current system, and those with low incomes may need more help. The support this implies for the redistributive impact of government does not appear to be primarily motivated by concerns about making incomes more equal, but rather the outcome of belief in a system in which everyone can get help when they need it, and everyone contributes according to their means.",I
"Gabrielle Preston","Helter skelter: families, disabled children and the benefit system","Families with disabled children are susceptible to poverty because low income is compounded by high costs. Combing caring with employment is extremely difficult, so families are heavily reliant upon benefits. But do disability benefits provide financial security for families who are susceptible to high levels of poverty and social exclusion? This qualitative study, based on semi-structured interviews with 20 families who have a disabled child or children, investigates their experience of applying for disability living allowance (DLA) and how they use additional benefit income. Families report that DLA makes a significant difference, not just for the disabled child but for the whole family. However, the fact that DLA is repeatedly downrated or withdrawn generates considerable fluctuations in income and high levels of stress and ill health. The report outlines issues that must be addressed if reduce poverty amongst disabled children is to be reduced.",I
"Bingqin Li|David Piachaud","Poverty and inequality and social policy in China","Despite prolonged economic growth, poverty has become a more notable and noted feature of Chinese society. The paper examines three phases of development since the foundation of the Peopleâs Republic: the central planning era (1949 â1978); the pro-urban growth model (1978 â 1999); and more recent changes (1999 â 2004). For each phase the nature of the economic and social policies are described and the effects on poverty and inequality are examined. The limitations of a social policy that is subservient to the economic strategy are considered. The alternative of a model of social development based on the livelihood approach is analysed and its potential to reduce poverty and inequality are considered.",I
"Simon Burgess|Carol Propper|John A. Rigg","The impact of low income on child health: evidence from a birth cohort study","There is a growing literature that shows that higher family income is associated with better health for children. Wealthier parents may have more advantaged children because they have more income to buy health care or because parental wealth is associated with beneficial behaviours or because parental health is associated with both income and childrenÂ¿s health. The policy implications of these transmission mechanisms are quite different. We attempt to unpick the correlation between income and health by examining routes by which parental disadvantage is transmitted into child disadvantage. Using a UK cohort study that has rich information on motherÂ¿s early life events, her health, her behaviours that may affect child health, and her childÂ¿s health, we examine the impact of being in low income compared to that of mother child health related behaviours and motherÂ¿s own health on child health. We find children from poorer households have poorer health. But we find the direct impact of income is small. A larger role is played by motherÂ¿s own health and events in her early life. No clear role is played by mother child health production behaviours. Written with ALSPAC study team.",I
"Anne Power","Neighbourhood management and the future of urban areas","This paper is about low-income neighbourhoods, their organisation and management. It is not a study in deprivation, but is about problem-solving, about the reforms in delivery underway in Britain, about long run attempts to change neighbourhood conditions and environments, about the central role of local government and housing organisations in tackling ground-level problems. It addresses environmental and social problems within neighbourhoods as part of a wider understanding of social exclusion, sustainable development and the need for greater care of our urban communities. Although its perspective is shaped by British examples, many of the issues are relevant to other countries. Although its focus is on low-income urban neighbourhoods of predominantly rented housing, the ideas can be applied to any neighbourhood of whatever tenure, size or location. This revised up-dated edition takes account of the ODPM's Neighbourhood Renewal Unit, and the Neighbourhood Management and Neighbourhood Warden Schemes they are supporting.",I
"Ruth Lupton","'Neighbourhood effects': can we measure them and does it matter?","Renewed interest in disadvantaged neighbourhoods is generating increasing research activity. Current work includes qualitative community studies and quantitative investigations of area effects on individual outcomes. This paper criticises the contribution of area effects research to date. Methodological and data constraints mean that quantitative studies often operationalise a weak conception of neighbourhood that does not reflect the understanding gained from qualitative work. These constraints present a barrier to testing specific theories that might usefully inform policy, while exaggerated claims are made about the policy relevance of more generic work. The paper concludes that area effects should be accorded less significance in the broad debate on area-based policy. Multi-disciplinary work is needed to develop studies that can influence the design of specific programmes.",I
"Sally Witcher","Reviewing the terms of inclusion: transactional processes, currencies and context","This paper sets out an overarching theoretical framework for explaining and exploring the processes of social exclusion, incorporating themes from the literature. It proposes that inclusion hinges on participation in social relationships enacted through Â¿transactional processesÂ¿, where currencies are assessed and goods distributed or withheld accordingly. Â¿CurrenciesÂ¿ are not just financial, but also human Â¿ evidence of human or social capital Â¿ what people have, do or are. The currencies required depend on the objective of the transaction. However, even where people have currency, transaction may be prevented by inaccessible infrastructure (buildings, transport, communications, etc), or through failure to recognize currency. Both poverty (lack of capital or currencies) and discrimination (failure to enable, recognize, or act consistently upon, the presentation of currencies) need to be tackled. The components that make up social context are explored: the norms and socio-cultural objectives (economic, social, political, etc) and the transactions, currencies and goods which are consequently prioritized. Terms of inclusion may accommodate more, or less, objectives, currencies and goods, notwithstanding that some objectives will be mutually incompatible and that production of certain goods (e.g. land) cannot be increased. Objectives and norms impact on how identity is construed, or misconstrued. A typology of discrimination is described, along with its potential exclusory outcomes. Yet, changes in attitudes and priorities might reveal scope for redrafting the terms of inclusion to promote and preserve greater diversity within the mainstream.",I
"Bruce Katz","Smart growth: the future of the American metropolis?","In the past few years, widespread frustration with sprawling development patterns has precipitated an explosion in innovative thinking and action across the United States. This new thinking Â¿ generally labeled as Â¿smart growthÂ¿ Â¿ contends that the shape and quality of metropolitan growth in America are no longer desirable or sustainable. It argues that metropolitan areas could grow in radically different ways if major government policies on land use, infrastructure and taxation were overhauled. This essay discusses the current state of smart growth and metropolitan thinking in the United States. It outlines the demographic, market and development trends that are affecting metropolitan areas and the consequences of these trends for central cities, older suburbs, newer communities and low-income and minority families. It describes how current government policies facilitate the excessive decentralization of people and jobs and how smart growth reforms are being enacted, particularly at the state level, to shape new, more urban-friendly, growth patterns. It concludes by identifying the major challenges that smart growth needs to address if it is going to succeed in shaping new, sustainable metropolitan communities.",R
"William Julius Wilson","Expanding the domain of policy-relevant scholarship in the social sciences","In this paper the author argues that social scientists need to do more to provide policy-relevant research. Rapid technological and economic change raise new issues about how policy should adjust that are not adequately addressed by older and narrower approaches. The author suggests two ways in which the domain of policy-relevant scholarship can be expanded. First, social scientists should be more flexible about the kinds of data they use and the ways they use them. Preliminary data can suggest new hypotheses, which can widen debate, and ethnographic and other qualitative methods can uncover patterns of behaviour invisible in quantitative sources. Second, social theories, concepts and ideas should play a greater role in the policy arena, shaping the way policy actors think about how the world works.",I
"Jo Blanden|Stephen Machin","Educational inequality and the expansion of UK higher education","In this paper we explore changes over time in higher education (HE) participation and attainment between people from richer and poorer family backgrounds during a time period when the UK higher education system expanded at a rapid rate. We use longitudinal data from three time periods to study temporal shifts in HE participation and attainment across parental income groups for children going to university in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. The key finding is a highly policy relevant one, namely that HE expansion has not been equally distributed across people from richer and poorer backgrounds. Rather, it has disproportionately benefited children from relatively rich families. Despite the fact that many more children from higher income backgrounds participated in HE before the recent expansion of the system, the expansion acted to widen participation gaps between rich and poor children. This finding is robust to different measures of education participation and inequality. It also emerges from non-parametric estimations and from a more detailed econometric model allowing for the sequential nature of education choices with potentially different income associations at different stages of the education sequence.",I
"Helena Holmlund","A researcher's guide to the Swedish compulsory school reform","When studying different types of returns to education, educational reforms are commonly used in the economics literature as a source of exogenous variation in education. The Swedish compulsory school reform is one example; the reform extended compulsory education throughout the country, in different municipalities at different points in time. Such variation across cohorts and regions can be used in a differences-in-differences framework, in order to estimate causal effects of education. This paper provides a guide to researchers who consider using the Swedish reform in an empirical analysis: I present a description and background of the reform, provide some baseline results, a reliability analysis of the reform coding, a discussion of whether the reform is a valid instrument, and comment on the interpretation of IV estimates of returns to schooling. The main conclusions are the following: i) a reliability analysis of the reform coding finds a lower bound reliability estimate of 0.66-0.91; ii) the reform indeed raised educational attainment, more so for boys than for girls, and iii) with careful consideration of region-specific trends, the reform can be considered a valid instrument for education.",I
"Stephen Machin|Shqiponja Telhaj|Joan Wilson","The mobility of English school children","In this paper we examine links between pupil mobility and pupil and school characteristics at all levels of compulsory schooling in England. We derive measures of mobility from two academic years of the Pupil Level Annual School Census (PLASC) data, a unique national administrative pupil level longitudinal data source. Our findings suggest that mobile pupils are more socially disadvantaged than non-mobile pupils and are significantly less likely to have a good prior education record. Moreover, we find that pupils are less likely to move if the school they attend has good average performance levels. Finally, when children move school, they are more likely to end up in a school with better Key Stage performance than the one they left, but this improvement is significantly more marked for children from better off backgrounds.",I
"Stephen Gibbons|Shqiponja Telhaj","Are schools drifting apart? Intake stratification in English secondary schools","The issue of social segregation in schools has seen a recent resurgence of interest â in the US, UK and internationally â as the debate rages on about whether policies that expand familiesâ freedom to choose amongst schools encourage divergence or convergence in the types of pupil different schools admit. Most attention has been focussed on segregation along lines of ethnic or social background. Yet, the real consideration that seems to be in the back of most peopleâs minds is the issue of segregation or stratification of schools along lines of pupil ability. We look explicitly at this issue using data on the population of pupils entering Secondary school in England from 1996 to 2002. Our study does highlight wide disparities between peer-group ability in different schools. But we also find that, contrary to popular opinion, almost nothing has changed over these years in terms of the way pupils of different age-11 abilities are sorted into different Secondary schools.",I
"Alejandro Cunat|Marc J. Melitz","Volatility, labor market flexibility, and the pattern of comparative advantage","This paper studies the link between volatility, labor market flexibility, and international trade. International differences in labor market regulations affect how firms can adjust to idiosyncratic shocks. These institutional differences interact with sector specific differences in volatility (the variance of the firm-specific shocks in a sector) to generate a new source of comparative advantage. Other things equal, countries with more flexible labor markets specialize in sectors with higher volatility. Empirical evidence for a large sample of countries strongly supports this theory: the exports of countries with more flexible labor markets are biased towards high-volatility sectors. We show how differences in labor market institutions can be parsimoniously integrated into the workhorse model of Ricardian comparative advantage of Dornbush, Fisher and Samuelson (1977). We also show how our model can be extended to multiple factors of production.",F
"Hilary Steedman|Sheila Stoney","Disengagement 14-16: context and evidence","This paper presents an overview of our current state of knowledge regarding poor motivation of 14-16 year old school pupils in the UK. A number of experts in the field from a variety of disciplines presented papers on this topic to a series of seminars held at the London School of Economics between 2002 and 2003. These papers, summarised here, present evidence from a historical, comparative, and social science perspectives and report the results of evaluation of government intervention programmes to improve motivation. International comparisons (PISA) show UK disengagement below the OECD average but the UK has the strongest link between socioeconomic disadvantage and disengagement. We identify a very small âout of touchâ group who have practically lost touch with school and a larger group â around one fifth of the cohort - who could be characterised as âdisaffected but in touchâ. Finally, we identify a further group â perhaps 15 per cent of the cohort who gain between 1 and 4 GCSE passes at Grades A*-C but who have not reached full potential as a result of loss of interest in learning. The âout of touchâ group often requires intensive one-on-one mentoring outside the school context. Evaluation of government intervention programmes has not so far shown an obvious way forward for the âdisaffected but in touchâ group, targeted principally by workplace learning measures. For the â1-4 Grade Câ group, there may be something of a magic bullet - namely better vocational options.",I
"Stephen Gibbons|Stephen Machin","Valuing rail access using transport innovations","In this paper we implement a powerful empirical approach than has not previously been applied to rail transport evaluation to ascertain how much consumers value rail access. We study the effects on house prices of a transport innovation that altered the distance to the nearest station for some households, but left others unaffected. The transport innovation we study is the construction of new stations under improvements made to the London Underground and Docklands Light Railway in South East London in the late 1990s. Using the innovation to implement a quasi-experimental approach studying house price changes in affected versus unaffected areas allows us to avoid the biases inherent in cross-sectional valuation work. Our evidence on distance-station effects on prices suggests that rail access is significantly valued by households and that these valuations are sizable as compared to the valuations of other local amenities and services.",R

We discuss each of these features in turn, and develop formal economic models of two of them. Face-to-face is particularly important in environments where information is imperfect, rapidly changing, and not easily codified, key features of many creative activities.",R
"Andrew B. Bernard|J. Bradford Jensen|Peter K. Schott","Falling trade costs, heterogeneous firms and industry dynamics","This paper examines the response of industries and firms to changes in trade costs. Several new firm-level models of international trade with heterogeneous firms predict that industry productivity will rise as trade costs fall due to the reallocation of activity across plants within an industry. Using disaggregated U.S. import data, we create a new measure of trade costs over time and industries. As the models predict, productivity growth is faster in industries with falling trade costs. We also find evidence supporting the major hypotheses of the heterogeneous-firm models. Plants in industries with falling trade costs are more likely to die or become exporters. Existing exporters increase their shipments abroad. The results do not apply equally across all sectors but are strongest for industries most likely to be producing horizontally-differentiated tradeable goods.",F
"Adriana Di Liberto|James Symons","Education and Italian regional development","Given recent emphasis on externality to education, macroeconomic studies have a role to play in the analysis of return to schooling. In this paper we study the connection between growth and human capital in a convergence regression for the panel of Italian regions. We include measures of average, primary, secondary and tertiary education. We find that increased education seems to contribute to growth only in the South. Decomposing total schooling into its three constituent parts, we find that only primary education in the South seems to be important. The results thus suggest that the Italian growth benefited from the elimination of illiteracy in the South, mainly in the 1960s, but not from the substantial increases in education at the other levels.",I
"Bingqin Li|Mark Duda|Huamin Peng","Low-cost urban housing markets: serving the needs of low-wage, rural-urban migrants?","This paper fills some of the gaps regarding housing choice, demand, and quality among Chinaâs rural-to-urban migrants using data from a purpose-designed survey of 800 low-status migrants in Tianjin. Results show that many migrants do not to exercise housing âchoiceâ but, rather, undergo housing âsortingâ that follows from occupational choices. Less than half of respondents obtained housing in the private rental market and only a slightly higher share pay any rent. Employment variables (industry sector, employer type) are consistently and strongly significant across our housing choice models and significantly affect housing quality as well. Nonetheless, a low-cost rental sector does exist, serving about two-fifths of migrants in our sample. Within this subset, housing demand is more consistent with theory in the sense that income and life cycle factors are important and employment sector has weaker effects. We read the studyâs findings as an indication that the primary policy prescription of the urban China housing choice literature as it pertains to rural-to-urban migrants â the need to eliminate institutional barriers that limit access to certain kinds of housing - is desirable but inadequate and may not respond to the concerns of migrants themselves.",R
"Bingqin Li|Gong Sen","Social inequalities and wage, housing and pension reforms in urban China","This paper studies the sources of social inequalities largely neglected by the previous researches on urban Chinaâs socio-economic reforms. The research focuses on the policy guided differential treatments to the employees of non-enterprises and the employees of enterprises in the reforms of the work related rewarding schemes, including wage, pension and housing. A simple model is developed to look at the determinants of individualsâ total work rewards and the combined effects of these reforms. The authors use the model to explain the logic behind the seemingly random welfare reform policies and their interactions with the wage reforms. This paper argues that the average amount of reward for the nonenterprise employees is consistently higher than that for the enterprise employees in all the three aspects of wage, housing and pensions. The gap has widened in recent years. The welfare reforms reinforce the income inequalities between the two groups.",I

"Kathleen Scanlon|Jens Lunde|Christine M. E. Whitehead","Mortgage product innovation in advanced economies: more choice, more risk","In many developed countries, house prices have been rising rapidly, mortgage debt has been increasing and affordability has worsened. It is in this context that the standard annuity mortgage is increasingly being supplanted by mortgages with non-standard features, such as longer terms or interest-only payments. Many of these new features aim to reduce the borrower's monthly debt service in the initial period of the loan. While these new mortgage types help households to enter owner-occupation and to vary their expenditure patterns, the long-term cost to the borrower cannot normally be less than for a standard product. Moreover, such mortgages can also be more risky: the interest-only borrower does not accumulate equity as an annuity borrower does, and loans with longer terms expose the borrower to greater risk of interest-rate or other economic shocks. As a result both borrowers pay more and the housing finance system may be more fragile.",R

Multidimensional poverty is measured in the domain of education, health and living standard and child health is measured with respect to infant mortality rate, the underfive mortality rate, immunization of children and medical assistance at birth. Results indicate that one-fifth of the households in India are abject poor; half of them are poor and the poor have limited access to child care. While infant mortality rate and under-five mortality rate are disproportionately higher among the abject poor compared to the non-poor, there are no significant differences in child survival among the educational, economical and health poor at the national level. Regional patterns in child survival among education, economical and health poor are mixed.",I

We focused on areas of interest to the DataPrev project: early years and parenting interventions, actions set in schools and workplaces and measures targeted at older people. Economic evaluations had to have some focus on promotion of mental health and well-being and/or primary prevention of poor mental health through health-related means. Studies preventing exacerbations in existing mental health problems were excluded, with the exception of support for parents with mental health problems, which might indirectly affect the mental health of their children. Overall 47 studies were identified. There was considerable variability in their quality, with a variety of outcome measures and different perspectives: societal, public purse, employer or health system used, making policy comparisons difficult. Caution must therefore be exercised in interpreting results, but the case for investment in parenting and health visitor-related programmes appears most strong, especially when impacts beyond the health sector are taken into account. In the workplace an economic return on investment in a number of comprehensive workplace health promotion programmes and stress management projects (largely in the USA) was reported, while group-based exercise and psychosocial interventions are of potential benefit to older people. Many gaps remain; a key first step would be to make more use of the existence evidence base on effectiveness and model mid- to long-term costs and benefits of action in different contexts and settings.",I

"Tasha Fairfield","Business power and protest: Argentinaâs agricultural producers protest in comparative context","The rare but important phenomenon of business protest has not been adequately addressed in either literature on contentious politics or literature on business politics. Using Argentina's 2008 agricultural producers' protests as an illustration, this paper develops the concept of business protest and situates it within the classic framework of business' instrumental power, exercised through political actions, and structural power, arising from individual profit-maximizing behavior. Business protest entails public and/or disruptive collective action in either the economic arena or the societal arena. Business actors are most likely to consider protest in order to defend their core interests when their structural power is weak and when they lack sources of instrumental power that enhance the effectiveness of ordinary political actions like lobbying. I apply the business power and protest framework to explain the Argentine producers' failure to influence export tax policy from 2002 through early 2008 and the emergence of protest against a 2008 tax increase. I then examine how the producers' protests contributed to the reform's repeal. The producers' protests are an exceptional example of business protest in which the participants lacked key organizational resources that facilitate collective action.",M

In this paper, we consider stochastic extensions in order to capture unknown influences (changing behaviors, public interventions, seasonal effects, etc.). These models assign diffusion processes to the time-varying parameters, and our inferential procedure is based on a suitably adjusted adaptive particle Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. The performance of the proposed computational methods is validated on simulated data and the adopted model is applied to the 2009 H1N1 pandemic in England. In addition to estimating the effective contact rate trajectories, the methodology is applied in real time to provide evidence in related public health decisions.

The two most interesting cases are a coordination game where both firms investing and non-investing are equilibria, and a chicken game where only one firm invests while the other is possibly driven (endogenously) out of the market. Our results suggest that product differentiation has an ambiguous impact on investment in advertising and that strong product substitutability may induce a coordination problem.",M

The analyses derived from Structural Equation Modelling show that economic deprivation and maternal depression separately and collectively diminish the cognitive and emotional well-being of children, and part of this diminution emanates from less nurturing and engaged parenting by those with less economic and emotional resources.",I

We begin by examining gaps in school readiness between low-, middle-, and high-income children,  drawing on data from new large and nationally representative birth cohort studies in the USA and UK. We find that sizable income-related gaps in school readiness are present in both countries before children enter school and then decompose these gaps to identify the factors that account for the poorer scores of low-income children. We then consider what role early years policy could play in tackling these gaps, drawing on the best available evidence to identify promising programs.",I

"Ian Gough","Globalization and regional welfare regimes: the East Asian case","This article contributes to the ongoing debate about the impact of globalization on welfare systems across the world. Its argument is that economic globalization alters the global balance of forces compared with the âGolden Ageâ of welfare capitalism, but that its impact on policies and outcomes is decisively mediated by national and regional âwelfare regimes'. This argument has been developed in relation to the advanced capitalist countries of the north, but is rarely applied to the south. This article applies the argument to the south through a case study of five economically successful countries in East Asia: Korea, Malaysia, Thailand, the Philippines and Indonesia. It depicts and analyses their welfare regimes using a new conceptual framework developed at the University of Bath. It then considers the impact of the Asian financial crisis as an example of the new risks faced by exposed countries in the global economy. The conclusion is that, despite common, sudden and decisive macroeconomic problems, the social policy reactions have differed across the five countries, in part reflecting variations in their welfare regimes.",I

"Leonardo Baccini","Cheap talk: transaction costs, quality of institutions, and trade agreements","While there is evidence that politics matter for international cooperation, the impact on economic integration of the quality of institutions has been given short shrift in the previous literature. I argue that the quality of institutions raises the quantity and the quality of information available to potential member states during the bargaining phase of a trade agreement. In turn, this inflow of information reduces the negotiation period of an agreement and, in doing so, dampens the transaction costs associated with it. As a result, countries with good institutions are more likely to form trade agreements. Using original data on both the formation of trade agreements and the duration of negotiations, I quantitatively test this argument. The results strongly support the claim that the quality of institutions is a crucial driver in explaining the recent wave of regionalism.",F
"Leonardo Baccini","Democratization and trade policy: an empirical analysis of developing countries","I show that the process of democratization in developing countries constitutes an important factor in the formation of preferential trade agreements. Specifically, democratizing developing countries are more likely to form a preferential trade agreement with richer countries, whereas there is little evidence that democratic transition affects the probability of a developing country joining a preferential trade agreement with other developing countries. This result follows naturally from median voter preferences and the HeckscherâOhlin and StolperâSamuelson theorems. Put simply, the median voter gains from trading with the richer states and loses from trading with the other poor states. Since preferential trade agreements allow countries to wave the most-favored nation principle, the need for both trade openness and protectionism against competitors might explain why preferential trade agreements constitute one of the main features of the current wave of globalization. I quantitatively test this hypothesis using a newly compiled dataset that covers 135 developing countries from 1990 to 2007. An important implication of this article is that it could be more challenging than expected to combine domestic political equality with international economic equality.",F

I argue that when forming a trade agreement the EU is more likely to target countries that have a higher degree of political and economic transparency than other developing countries. In highly transparent countries the EU is able to monitor effectively whether or not these countries follow its forms of conditionality, which is the main rationale of EU regionalism. Moreover, economic and political transparency plays a particularly important role in determining the degree of flexibility in trade agreements. Evidence based on data from 138 developing countries supports these arguments.",F
"Robert H. Chenhall|Matthew Hall|David Smith","The expressive role of performance measurement systems: a field study of a mental health development project","The management control systems (MCS) literature has long recognized the importance of values and beliefs (e.g., Ouchi, 1979; Simons, 1995). However, in this literature, values and beliefs are typically presented in the context of mission statements or company slogans that can play little substantive role in shaping actions and behaviours. In this paper we focus on how MCS can play a more active role in values expression, and examine the potential for performance measurement systems (PMS) to be used within organizations to express the values and beliefs of organizational members. This use of PMS, which we term its expressive role, is important as pluralistic and expressive forms of organizing are becoming more prevalent. Furthermore, prior research indicates that enabling the expression of values and beliefs by organizational members can generate energy and commitment that are important to the achievement of organizational objectives. In a field study of a mental health development project in a non-government organization, we examine the design and operational characteristics that are important for the expressive role of PMS. We also examine the interplay between the expressive role and the instrumental role of PMS and identify circumstances in which these roles can clash and/or be complementary.",M
"Matthew Hall","Evaluation logics in the third sector","In this paper I provide a preliminary sketch of the types of logics of evaluation in the third sector. I begin by tracing the ideals that are evident in three well-articulated yet quite different third sector evaluation practices: the logical framework, most significant change stories, and social return on investment. Drawing on this analysis, I then tentatively outline three logics of evaluation: a scientific evaluation logic (systematic observation, observable and measurable evidence, objective and robust experimental procedures), a bureaucratic evaluation logic (complex, step-by-step procedures, analysis of intended objectives), and a learning evaluation logic (openness to change, wide range of perspectives, lay rather than professional expertise). These logics draw attention to differing conceptions of knowledge and expertise and their resource implications, and have important consequences for the professional status of the practitioners, consultants, and policy makers that contribute to and/or are involved in evaluations in third sector organizations",M

It examines the implication of private sector accounting and consulting expertise in redefining prison values and prison performance, and it discusses the consequences this had for definitions of risk and responsibility. The paper shows how the reforms promoted a systemic decentring of Prison Service accountability. Prison managers and regulators came to be inserted into hierarchies of expertise and credibility shaped by quests for commensuration and auditability. Further, the paper shows how the reform attempts brought about a situation of institutional lock-in by contributing, as the outgoing HM Chief Inspector of Prisons Anne Owers has put it in 2010, to the creation of an inflated prison system âtoo big to fail, and too big to succeed'.",M
"Kristian Wahlbeck|David McDaid","Actions to alleviate the mental health impact of the economic crisis","The current global economic crisis is expected to produce adverse mental health effects that may increase suicide and alcohol-related death rates in affected countries. In nations with greater social safety nets, the health impacts of the economic downturn may be less pronounced. Research indicates that the mental health impact of the economic crisis can be offset by various policy measures. This paper aims to outline how countries can safeguard and support mental health in times of economic downturn. It indicates that good mental health cannot be achieved by the health sector alone. The determinants of mental health often lie outside of the remits of the health system, and all sectors of society have to be involved in the promotion of mental health. Accessible and responsive primary care services support people at risk and can prevent mental health consequences. Any austerity measures imposed on mental health services need to be geared to support the modernization of mental health care provision. Social welfare supports and active labour market programmes aiming at helping people retain or re-gain jobs can counteract the mental health effects of the economic crisis. Family support programmes can also make a difference. Alcohol pricing and restrictions of alcohol availability reduce alcohol harms and save lives. Support to tackle unmanageable debt will also help to reduce the mental health impact of the crisis. While the current economic crisis may have a major impact on mental health and increase mortality due to suicides and alcohol-related disorders, it is also a window of opportunity to reform mental health care and promote a mentally healthy lifestyle.",I

Covering different aspects of consumer decision making, we discuss the conditions under which different types of processes are evoked, how they interact and how they apply to consumersâ processing of marketing messages, the evaluation of product-related information, and purchasing behavior. We further compare and contrast theoretical strands and incorporate them with the literature on attitudes, showing how duality models can help us understand implicit and explicit attitude formation in consumer psychology. Finally, we offer future research implications for scholars in consumer psychology and marketing.",M

Cross-sectional population data from the 2004 National Sample Survey Organisation were used, which considered 9,643 households for the analysis where at least one woman received maternal health care services during the year preceding the survey. Multilevel linear regression techniques were used to estimate the effect of household, cluster and state characteristics on the proportion of maternal health care expenditures over total household expenditures. Over 80 % of households reported paying for maternal health care services, with those using private care facilities paying almost 4 times more than those using public facilities. Multilevel analyses show evidence of high burden of maternal health care expenditures, which varied significantly across states according to the level of health care utilisation, and with considerable heterogeneity at the household and community levels. Maternal health care services in India are offered free at the point of delivery, yet many families face significant out-of-pocket expenditures. The recent governmental policy interventions to encourage institutional births by providing nominal financial assistance is a welcome step but this might not help to compensate mothers for other indirect expenditures, especially those living in rural areas and poorer communities who are increasingly seeking care in private facilities.",I

"Corinna Sorenson|Michael Drummond|Beena Bhuiyan Kahn","Medical technology as a key driver of rising health expenditures: disentangling the relationship","Health care spending has risen steadily in most countries, becoming a concern for decision-makers worldwide. Commentators often point to new medical technology as the key driver for burgeoning expenditures. This paper critically appraises this conjecture, based on an analysis of the existing literature, with the aim of offering a more detailed and considered analysis of this relationship. Several databases were searched to identify relevant literature. Various categories of studies (eg, multivariate and cost-effectiveness analyses) were included to cover different perspectives, methodological approaches, and issues regarding the link between medical technology and costs. Selected articles were reviewed and relevant information was extracted into a standardized template and analyzed for key cross-cutting themes, ie, impact of technology on costs, factors influencing this relationship, and methodological challenges in measuring such linkages. A total of 86 studies were reviewed. The analysis suggests that the relationship between medical technology and spending is complex and often conflicting. Findings were frequently contingent on varying factors, such as the availability of other interventions, patient population, and the methodological approach employed. Moreover, the impact of technology on costs differed across technologies, in that some (eg, cancer drugs, invasive medical devices) had significant financial implications, while others were cost-neutral or cost-saving. In light of these issues, we argue that decision-makers and other commentators should extend their focus beyond costs solely to include consideration of whether medical technology results in better value in health care and broader socioeconomic benefits.",I
"Ama de-Graft Aikins","Familiarising the unfamiliar: cognitive polyphasia, emotions and the creation of social representations","Within the Social Representations Theory (SRT) paradigm, social representations are defined technically as practical social knowledge that is produced when groups and individuals encounter the unfamiliar. Social representations therefore function to familiarise the unfamiliar. Theorists also assert that social representations âcreate realityâ: they constitute processes through which new meanings and social identities are created and projected into the social world. Both themes are informed by Moscoviciâs formulation of a âprinciple of familiarityâ. This principle is deemed to be universal and to constitute two interdependent sociopsychological processes: a preference for, and attachment to familiarity that co-exists with and drives resistance to unfamiliarity. A common â and paradoxical - application of this principle to knowledge production states that individuals and communities are motivated to familiarise the unfamiliar because of the threat the unfamiliar poses to the safety of what is known. In this paper I argue that Moscoviciâs âprinciple of familiarityâ is conceptually limited. By overemphasising an interdependent relationship between âattachment to the familiarâ and âfear of the unfamiliarâ, the principle (a) ignores more plausible motivations driving the creation of social representations and (b) undermines the constructivist character of the phenomena.I discuss anthropological evidence on African communities that are âopen to the unfamiliarâ. In contrast to Moscoviciâs universal âprinciple of familiarityâ these communities are motivated to familiarise the unfamiliar because of the risks and threats inherent in the familiar and the power attributed to the unfamiliar. Drawing on Moscoviciâs reflections on cognitive polyphasia and broader SRT discussions about social representations as cognitive-emotional processes, I consider conceptual challenges this counter-evidence poses to social representations theory in its broader project as a universal theory of social knowledge.",I

It explores the preconditions for this shift in three stages. First, it explores how failure came to be âforgivenâ in both the U.S. and the U.K. across the nineteenth century, how it came to be defined as something that is economic or financial, rather than personal or moral. Second, it explores the rapid growth of narrating and rating failure in the mid nineteenth century, with particular attention to the formation of credit rating agencies from the 1840s onwards. We consider also the roles played in this process by two fortuitous technological developments â the typewriter, and carbon paper for copying. Third, we examine the emergence of the calculative infrastructure which has helped to establish an industry of attempts to forecast failure from the beginning of the twentieth century, initially on the basis of financial ratios, and more recently through the use of risk indexes. We use the term âcalculating failureâ to describe this transformation and economisation of both the ideas and the instruments of failure, and suggest that this has significant implications for the study of strategy.",M

Extending the analysis, we find such persistence to vary with age at impact, gender, and mental health sub-categories. This investigation allows us to get a grasp on the degree to which childhood events influence health and socio-economic outcomes by way of their lagged effect on subsequent mental health. A better understanding of the evolution of mental health also helps identifying when mental health issues can be most effectively treated.",I

Using student-level data on the University of California system during a period in which racial preferences were in place, we show significant sorting into majors based on academic preparation, with science majors at each campus having on average stronger credentials than their non-science counterparts. Students with relatively weaker academic preparation are significantly more likely to leave the sciences and take longer to graduate at each campus. We show the vast majority of minority students would be more likely to graduate with a science degree and graduate in less time had they attended a lower ranked university.

We show that a firm's number of buyers and the distribution of sales across them systematically vary with the characteristics of its destination markets. While most firms serve only very few buyers abroad, the number of buyers and the skewness of sales across them increases with the size and the accessibility of destinations. We develop a simple model of selection with heterogeneous buyers and sellers consistent with these findings in which tougher competition induces a better alignment between consumers' ideal variants and firms' core competencies. This generates an additional channel through which tougher competition leads to higher productivity and higher welfare and hints at an additional source of gains from trade as long as freer trade fosters competition.",F

"Mark Thatcher","European Commission merger control: combining competition and the creation of larger European firms","The article examines the European Commission's use of its legal powers over mergers. It discusses and tests two views. One is that the 'neoliberal' Commission has ended previous industrial policies of aiding 'national champion' firms to grow through mergers and instead pursues a 'merger-constraining' policy of vigorously using its legal powers to block mergers. The other is that the Commission follows an 'integrationist policy' of seeking the development of larger European firms to deepen economic integration. It examines Commission decisions under the 1989 EC Merger Regulation between 1990 and 2009. It selects three major sectors that are 'likely' for the 'merger-constraining' view - banking, energy and telecommunications - and analyses a dataset of almost 600 Commission decisions and then individual merger cases. It finds that the Commission has approved almost all mergers, including by former 'national champion' firms. There have been only two prohibitions over 20 years in the three sectors and the outcome has been the creation of larger European firms through mergers. It explains how the Commission can pursue an integrationist policy through the application of competition processes and criteria. The wider implication is that the Commission can combine competition policy with achieving the 'industrial policy' aim of aiding the development of larger European firms.",F

To solve this confidentiality problem while also maintaining a high level of harmonisation of the key economic concepts (gross job flows, growth rates of employment, definition of high-growth firms, etc.), dynemp can be distributed in a network of researchers who have access to the national confidential microdata. In such manner, the rich firm-level employment dynamics can be analysed from new angles (such as firm age and size), significantly expanding the scope of the analysis insofar possible using more aggregated data.",M

Given the expected growth in the population of older adults and budget cuts on local government, it is important to find efficient ways of maintaining and improving the quality of life of older adults. The ageing in place literature suggests that policies in other functions of local authorities may have a significant role to play. This study aims to examine the associations between social care-related quality of life (SCRQoL) in older adults and three potential policy targets for local authorities: (i) accessibility of information and advice, (ii) design of the home and (iii) accessibility of the local area. We used cross-sectional data from the English national Adult Social Care Survey (ASCS) 2010/2011 on service users aged 65 years and older and living at home (N=29,935). To examine the association between SCRQoL, as measured by the ASCOT, and three single-item questions about accessibility of information, design of the home and accessibility of the local area, we estimate linear and quantile regression models. After adjusting for physical and mental health factors and other confounders our findings indicate that SCRQoL is significantly lower for older adults who find it more difficult to find information and advice, for those who report that their home design is inappropriate for their needs and for those who find it more difficult to get around their local area. In addition, these three variables are as strongly associated with SCRQoL as physical and mental health factors. We conclude that in seeking to find ways to maintain and improve the quality of life of social care users living at home, local authorities could look more broadly across their responsibilities. Further research is required to explore the cost-effectiveness of these options compared to standard social care services.",I
"Casey Rothschild|Florian Scheuer","A theory of income taxation under multidimensional skill heterogeneity","We develop a unifying framework for optimal income taxation in multi-sector economies with general patterns of externalities. Agents in this model are characterized by an N-dimensional skill vector corresponding to intrinsic abilities in N potentially externality-causing activities. The private return to each activity depends on individual skill and an aggregate activity-specific return, which is a fully general function of the economy-wide distribution of activity-specific efforts. We show that the N dimensional heterogeneity can be collapsed to a one-dimensional, endogenous statistic sufficient for screening. The optimal tax schedule features a multiplicative income specific correction to an otherwise standard tax formula. Because externalities change the relative returns to different activities, corrective taxes induce changes in the across activity allocation of effort. These relative return effects cause the optimal correction to diverge, in general, from the Pigouvian tax that would align private and social returns. We characterize this divergence and its implications for the shape of the tax schedule both generally and in a number of applications, including externality free economies, increasing and decreasing returns to scale, zero-sum activities such as bargaining or rent extraction, and positive or negative spillovers.",M
"John Hills","Labour's record on cash transfers, poverty, inequality and the lifecycle 1997 - 2010","Cash transfers (benefits and tax credits) are crucial to the way that inequalities develop over time. This paper looks at how Labourâs aims, policies and achievements on poverty and inequality related to its reforms of and spending on cash transfers. - Labourâs aims for poverty and inequality were selective. âEquality of opportunityâ was the stated aim, rather than equality of outcome â with a focus on lifting the lowest incomes, not reducing the highest ones. - Labour gave priority to reducing child and pensioner poverty, addressing them through a series of reforms. It increased the share of national income provided through cash transfers to children and pensioners, and increased the value of their cash transfers relative to the poverty line. - By contrast, spending on other transfers to working-age adults fell as a share of national income from the level Labour inherited, while benefits for those without children fell further below the poverty line. - By the end of the period both child poverty and pensioner poverty had fallen considerably, in circumstances where child poverty would have risen without the reforms (and pensioner poverty would have fallen less far). However, poverty for working-age adults without children increased. - The risks of poverty converged between children, their parents, pensioners, and other working age adults. Being a child or a pensioner no longer carried a much greater risk of living in poverty than for other age groups. - Overall income inequality was broadly flat, comparing the start and end of Labourâs term in office. But differences in net incomes between age groups were much lower. The smoothing of incomes that occurred across the life cycle could be seen as a striking, if unremarked, achievement.",I
"Calebe de Roure|Paolo Tasca","Bitcoin and the PPP Puzzle","This paper approaches the PPP puzzle by using the Bitcoin/US Dollar exchange rate. The use of the virtual currency as macroeconomic laboratory allows us to remove frictions that previously impeded the empirical demonstration of the law of one price. We show that price adjustments are still far from perfect due to information asymmetry between agents. Nevertheless, the real exchange rate is stationary and adjusts by 81% within one day. Finally, because of the different speed of information spread, good market arbitrage takes place in the Bitcoin economy but not in the US economy. Thus, we conclude that in a frictionless economy the PPP holds and the speed of arbitrage for the good market depends on the speed of information spread among agents.",F
"Nicholas Bloom|Erik Brynjolfsson|Lucia Foster|Ron Jarmin|Megha Patnaik|Itay Saporta-Eksten|John Van Reenen","IT and management in America","The Census Bureau recently conducted a survey of management practices in over 30,000 plants across the US, the first large-scale survey of management in America. Analyzing these data reveals several striking results. First, more structured management practices are tightly linked to higher levels of IT intensity in terms of a higher expenditure on IT and more on-line sales. Likewise, more structured management is strongly linked with superior performance: establishments adopting more structured practices for performance monitoring, target setting and incentives enjoy greater productivity and profitability, higher rates of innovation and faster employment growth. Second, there is a substantial dispersion of management practices across the establishments. We find that 18% of establishments have adopted at least 75% of these more structured management practices, while 27% of establishments adopted less than 50% of these. Third, more structured management practices are more likely to be found in establishments that export, who are larger (or are part of bigger firms), and have more educated employees. Establishments in the South and Midwest have more structured practices on average than those in the Northeast and West. Finally, we find adoption of structured management practices has increased between 2005 and 2010 for surviving establishments, particularly for those practices involving data collection and analysis.",M
"Esteban Aucejo|Teresa Romano","Assessing the effect of school days and absences  on test score performance","While instructional time is viewed as crucial to learning, little is known about the effectiveness of reducing absences relative to increasing the number of school days. In this regard, this paper jointly estimates the effect of absences and length of the school calendar on test score performance. Using administrative data from North Carolina public schools, we exploit a state policy that provides variation in the number of days prior to standardized testing and find substantial differences between these effects. Extending the school calendar by ten days increases math and reading test scores by only 0.8% and 0.2% of a standard deviation, respectively; a similar reduction in absences would lead to gains of 5.8% and 3% in math and reading. We perform a number of robustness checks including utilizing u data to instrument for absences, family-year fixed effects, separating excused and",I
"Ben Ansell|Lawrence Broz","Global capital markets, housing prices, and partisan fiscal policies","In recent years, global imbalances have channeled the excess savings of surplus countries toward the real estate markets of deficit countries. By consequence, the deficit countries that attracted lots of foreign capital experienced large run-ups in house prices while the surplus countries that exported capital exhibited flat or slow house price growth. We argue that international capital flows affect the fiscal policy preferences of both voters and political parties by way of their impact on housing prices. Where capital inflows are large and housing prices are rising, we expect voters to respond by demanding both lower taxes and less publicly-provided social insurance. This is because rising house prices allow homeowners to âself insureâ against income losses due to unemployment, illness, and old age. We present survey evidence that supports this claim. Furthermore, we find that responses to house prices are mirrored in capital exporting countries: households become more supportive of both taxes and social insurance as home prices remain flat or decline. Finally, we show that political parties are the mechanisms through which the fiscal preferences of households find policy expression. Taxes and social insurance spending tend to fall (rise) where the right (left) is in power and capital inflows are driving up housing prices. In capital exporting nations, by contrast, we find an attenuation of these partisan fiscal policy outcomes.",R
"Lawrence Broz","The Federal Reserve as global lender of last resort, 2007-2010","Passage of the Dodd-Frank financial reform bill, in conjunction with a Supreme Court ruling supporting a Freedom of Information Act request, required the Federal Reserve (Fed) to disclose bank-specific information about its emergency lending during the financial crisis. The disclosures revealed the extent to which the Fed had served as a global lender of last resort, providing dollar liquidity to foreign banks and foreign central banks. I exploit these unanticipated disclosures on two levels. First, I use the disclosed information to evaluate the motivations behind the Fed's global lending during the crisis. My findings indicate that the Fed supported foreign banks in countries in which U.S. money center banks had high loan exposures, which suggests that the Fed served the interests of major U.S. banks. Second, I explore the congressional response to the revelation of the Fed's massive global lending. I analyze an Audit the Fed vote in the House of Representatives that would end the Fed's confidentiality about the banks and countries it supports and reduce its monetary policy independence. I find the influence of U.S. money center banks also extends to Congress by way of campaign contributions: contributions from these banks significantly reduce the likelihood that a representative will vote in favor of the bill.  In addition, I find that right-wing representatives were substantially more likely than their left-wing peers to support the bill, which suggests that new congressional coalitions are forming on the role of the Fed in the (global) economy.",R
"Lucy Goodhart","Brave new world? Macro prudential policy and the new political economy of The Federal Reserve","The Financial Crisis that started in 2007 ushered in new responsibilities for central banks, particularly for what is termed âmacro-prudential policy,â or MPP. The goal of this policy is to monitor and contain overall risk in the financial sector. Implementing MPP, however, carries the potential for distributional conflict with the largest financial firms and the politicization of central bank policy. In light of this risk, this essay analyses the institutional implications of MPP for a leading central bank, the U.S. Federal Reserve. Specifically, how will MPP affect the autonomy of the Fed to set the policy it thinks right? The analysis is based on interviews with financial regulators, including Fed staffers and policymakers, and with journalists who report on financial regulation. It is also informed by a case study of the âVolcker Revolutionâ in monetary policy. Based on these sources, I identify the factors that contributed to Fed autonomy in the conduct of monetary policy during the Volcker Revolution and assess the extent to which those same factors hold for MPP. I close with an assessment of what MPP means for the new political economy of the Fed in particular and developed world central banks more broadly.",R
"Jeffrey Chwieroth|Andrew Walter","Great expectations, veto players, and the changing politics of banking crises","How have the politics of banking crises changed over the long run? Unlike existing static accounts, we offer a dynamic theory emphasizing how the emergence of votersâ âgreat expectationsâ after the 1930s concerning crisis prevention and mitigation reshaped the politics of banking crises in many democratic countries. We argue that both variations over time, centred on the emergence of these expectations, and variations within democratic countries, based on how veto players constrain policy change, exerted an important influence on the propensity of voters to punish incumbent political parties in the aftermath of banking crises. We find strong support for our argument using a new dataset of 100 democratic countries from 1831 â 2011. Political punishment in the aftermath of a banking crisis is mainly a modern phenomenon and is most evident in systems with polarized veto players.",R

I address this question in the context of the recent European sovereign debt crisis. Considering the network of Eurozone member states, interlinked through investment cross-holdings, I model default as a multi-stage disease with each credit-rating corresponding to a new infection phase, then derive systemic importance and vulnerability indicators in the presence of financial contagion, triggered by the change in the creditworthiness of a network member. I further extend the model to analyse not only negative, but also positive credit risk spillovers.",R

We show that currencies that perform badly (well) during periods of high cross-sectional disparity in conditional FX correlation yield high (low) average excess returns, suggesting that correlation risk is priced in currency markets. Furthermore, we find a negative cross-sectional relationship between average FX correlations and average FX correlation risk premia. Finally, we propose a no-arbitrage model that can match salient properties of FX correlations and correlation risk premia.",R
"Olivier Marie|Ulf ZÃ¶litz","'High' achievers? Cannabis access and academic performance","This paper investigates how legal cannabis access affects student performance. Identification comes from an exceptional policy introduced in the city of Maastricht which discriminated legal access based on individualsâ nationality. We apply a difference-in-difference approach using administrative panel data on over 54,000 course grades of local students enrolled at Maastricht University before and during the partial cannabis prohibition. We find that the academic performance of students who are no longer legally permitted to buy cannabis increases substantially. Grade improvements are driven by younger students, and the effects are stronger for women and low performers. In line with how THC consumption affects cognitive functioning, we find that performance gains are larger for courses that require more numerical/mathematical skills. We investigate the underlying channels using studentsâ course evaluations and present suggestive evidence that performance gains are driven by improved understanding of material rather than changes in studentsâ study effort.",I
"George Ward","Is happiness a predictor of election results?","Is it in politiciansâ interest to focus policy on subjective well-being (SWB)? Many governments and international organisations have recently begun to measure progress at least partly in terms of the populationâs SWB or âhappinessâ. This paper investigates the extent to which citizens themselves judge national success in such terms. Using cross-country panel data, the analysis shows that the electoral fate of governing parties is associated not only with the state of the macroeconomyâas a substantial literature on âeconomic votingâ suggestsâbut also with the electorateâs wider well-being. A countryâs aggregate level of SWB is able to account for more of the variance in government vote share than standard macroeconomic variables. This is consistent with a simple political agency model, and has implications for the incentives faced by politicians to act in the interests of voters.",I

"Richard Macve","Fair value vs conservatism? Aspects of the history of accounting, auditing, business and finance from ancient Mesopotamia to modern China","To help understand modern financial accounting theory (FAT) and its role in the development of finance and business, I consider two current mainstream histories of its development and offer a third alternative. The standard setters' version is that increasingly FAT is rationally derived from a basically coherent conceptual framework, currently focussed on âcomprehensive incomeâ as measured by âchanges in assets and liabilitiesâ, in turn preferably measured at fair values. However, examination here of several recent FASB/IASB standards and exposure drafts shows that instead they unavoidably bear the marks of the history of a variety of now embedded practices that have shaped thinking about, and vested interests in, what is âgood accountingâ. By contrast, some recent academic versions of history focus on how âconservativeâ, historical-cost based accounting principles have rationally evolved to provide an anchor on which to base appraisal of firms' and managers' performance, prospects and risks, and supply the kind of information that investors and other parties in the capital markets need to help overcome the information asymmetry between them and corporate managers. After analysing the limitations of this second type of history, I argue that even a brief genealogical examination of the conditions of possibility that have led to the growth and changes in accounting and auditing practices and discourses, and in the power-knowledge relations that they have engendered at different stages over the millennia of recorded history, suggests that their power has always been more that of âinstitutional rationalised mythâ. The twin rational myths of the objectivity of accounting and of auditing together provide the structure that offers the comfort necessary to enable the various agents in the modern, increasingly global, economy to undertake and finance the risks of acting âat a distanceâ and across time. This modern, grammatocentric accountability increasingly extends throughout the institutions that coordinate modern societies, in the rising East as well as in the established West. Exploring how much of FAT is rational and reflects some objective âeconomic realityâ and how much is myth and is subjectively, socially constructed; and, again, how much might be improved and how much is intractable, are the major questions now for accounting, auditing and finance policy-making and research. This requires further detailed comparative international historical understanding of how accounting and auditing have variously operated, within businesses and other organisations and in shaping markets, across different countries and cultures.",M

However, I critically evaluate this so-called non-uniformity prescription by considering the costs of local or situational adaptions. This naturally links with the homogenizing effects of globalization, where I ponder whether globalization might actually reduce the power of comparative studies across countries or regions, or whether, regardless, there remains great benefit to be had from studying local practices that can be theoretically generalized. I also offer some suggestions to help strengthen the design of comparative studies to try and maximize their (conceptual, if not econometric) power.",M

These data permit examination of a number of new dimensions of firm activity, including how many products firms trade, how many countries firms trade with, the characteristics of those countries, the concentration of trade across firms, whether firms transact at arms length or with related parties, and whether firms import as well as export. Firms that trade goods play an important role in the U.S., employing more than a third of the U.S. workforce. We find that the most globally engaged U.S. firms, i.e. those that both export to and import from related parties, dominate U.S. trade flows and employment at trading firms. We also find that firms that begin trading between 1993 and 2000 experience especially rapid employment growth and are a major force in overall job creation.",F

Many brands rely on their home country as a warranty for quality and prestige, in order to gain consumersâ interest and attention. This paper examines the moderating role of variables such as perceived quality, ethnocentrism and familiarity in determining a consumer to buy a domestic product. Through exploratory research, this study aims to investigate to what extent Romania, as country-of-origin for its local products, influences consumersâ decision making process.

Design/Methodology/Approach - The nature of the topic suggests the use of an interdisciplinary set of analysis, interpretation and evaluation of results, as well as the option for a joint research strategy, which is engaged in methods and techniques from many scientific fields, in order to validate the assumptions. Overview - Due to the unstable economic situation in Romania over the last few years, local entrepreneurs are interested to know the features, dynamics, and, above all, opportunities and threats specific to the European business environment to assess the chances of achieving their targets. Likewise, before making any investment decisions, foreign investors and entrepreneurs need to know exactly if and how the new business environment will support the development of their own businesses.

This exploratory research was conducted using two methods. An analysis of the secondary data offered by the specialized literature was followed by primary data collection, through structured interviews with the representatives of Southwest Airlines and JetBlue. The results show that the success of the two low-cost airlines was based not only on their cutting costs strategies, but also on the organizational culture they have promoted during time. This organizational culture is based on closed relationships between the employees, clients and suppliers, among which the communication is simplified and transparent. These particularities of the two operators have made huge differences between them and other low-cost airlines in terms of resilience to the economic downturns, increased number of transported passengers, of revenues and profits.",M

However, globalisation, production fragmentation and the growing importance of global value chains (GVCs) increasingly challenge traditional approaches of export competitiveness and call for a more accurate and disaggregated level of analysis. Due to the growing fragmentation of production, a country exports now include a significant amount of imports of intermediate goods which are part of the export value. In this case, a simple analysis of the evolution of exports can distort the international competitive position of a country.

First of all, accounting assumed a certain responsibility to the public interest, by its fundamental purpose, namely to provide financial-accounting information, information that will form the basis of decision making. Second of all, for the successful fulfilment of the public responsibilities, accountants must rely on elements of doctrine, ethics, or ethics and morality. The study wants to show the importance of the accounting discipline, which has begun to increasingly focus on the creation of a moral or ethical basis, putting these issues on the same level with respecting the law. The boundary between what is legal but not ethical or moral is very small, and there were many business cases where unethical behaviour led to business failure.",M

Their work does not generate enough capital to buy specialized software and the local community is too small to create open-source software for them.When adapting an open-source enterprise solution, from a certain level of integration, it is necessary to align to the Romanian legislation. For this you need more than a simple translation. For example, in accounting, the Romanian chart of accounts should be used, the local fiscal calendar, the rules of the Romanian legislation and the specific identifiers for Romanian companies. The solution: Open source applications can be localized. A small community cannot create complex system starting from nothing, but they can adapt existing ones already created and used all over the world. Given the individual characteristics of the Romanian market, open source ERP, CM and e-commerce will be integrated by specialized consultancy agency in Romania just as is done in France (Compiere), Spain (Openbravo), Belgium (OpenERP) or the United States (Apache oFBiz).

However, the correlation between the current exchange rate and future values of the trade balance may be positive. Previous research using aggregate trade flows between Brazil and rest of the world find weak support for the curve. When we disaggregate Brazils trade flows with the U.S. and investigate 95 industries that trade between the two countries, we find support for the S-curve in 51 industries.

model in which individuals rationally determine their body-mass by choosing food ingestion and time spent exercising. We show that multiple equilibria in body-mass might exist due to two forces with opposite effects. Firstly, an increase in body-mass has a negative impact on current utility and therefore, slows down body-mass accumulation. Secondly, an increase in body-mass has negative impact on the mortality rate, and thus on the individual's discount factor. This effect is associated with an individual's myopic behavior as more weight is given to current utility flow compared with future utility flows. As a result, the impact on the mortality rate accelerates the accumulation of body-mass throughout an increase in food ingestion and less time allocated to exercise. Thus, some individuals might be willing to ingest less food and spent more time exercising if they place more value on the negative impact of body-mass on their current utility, while others individuals might decide to accelerate body-mass if they face lower discounted future utility flows. A second conclusion relies on the stability of the different equilibria, which assures persistence in body-mass and explains why radical treatments might be required to modify an individual's weight.",I

We find that every year a large number of new exporting relationships are initiated, but the survival rate of these entries is very low and declines over time. Using unit values as a proxy for product quality, our estimations show that entry is generally associated with higher product quality. This higher product quality, however, tends to reduce over time and eventually disappears three years after entry. To better identify this effect, we explore whether there are systematic differences across sectors. As expected, for sectors in which quality differentiation may be important, our findings reveal that reference-price and differentiated products show a higher price in the year of entry and it takes longer to converge to the incumbent prices. These results hold after controlling for potential sample selection bias.",F
"Olesia  Kozlova","Forward-Rate Bias, Imperfect Knowledge, and Risk: Evidence from Developed and Developing Countries","This paper examines the stability of the basic regression underpinning the forward-discount anomaly for 20 developed and 32 developing countries. It finds that the correlation between the change of the spot exchange rate and forward discount is piece-wise linear in every country, involving stretches of time in which forward-rate bias is negative and other stretches of time in which it is positive. The results also point out to a new empirical finding that the average magnitude of the positive and negative biases that are found in each developed country tends to be larger than those for developing countries. The paper shows that a new risk premium model based on Imperfect Knowledge Economics can account for this pattern across developed and developing countries, thereby undercutting the widespread view in the literature that developed-country currency markets are characterized by a greater degree of irrationality than those for developing countries.",F

"Valentina Vasile|Mariana Balan","CHANGES IN LABOUR FORCE EXTERNAL MOBILITY MODEL FOR ROMANIANS. MAIN RESTRICTIONS AND CHALLENGES","The strongest determination of external labour mobility is given by the economicdevelopment level from the country of destination and the superior equivalent income that might beobtained by wage employment or entrepreneurship, as compared with the country of origin. Labourimmigrants represent the overwhelming share of immigrants (OECD, 2008). For less developedcountries, labour migration generates potential losses that cannot be substituted by remittances orother &lsquo;soft&lsquo; advantages which pertain to the labour market due to the increasingly longer period oftemporary migration.In the present paper we highlight the shifts in size and intensity of labour mobility flows forRomanians in the last decade. It is underpinned that the highest mobility propensity was registeredamong youths who, paradoxically to the economic growth context couldn&lsquo;t find adequate jobs in thecountry and accepted employment abroad - under conditions of underemployment, over-qualification and sometimes even in other fields of activity than the professional training profile.The first 5 countries of destination change the hierarchy in the Romanians&lsquo; preferences. Thischange of destinations signifies also a change of the structure according to educational level andprofile, decreasing the share of those with tertiary training, but not also the absolute number whichis increasing.

Within a global economicenvironment that is continuously evolving, there is a strong need for an internationally coordinatedaction as the financial and non-financial information disclosed by a company influences itsstrategic decisions. The topic of the current paper outlines the issue of integrated reporting as theinterconnection between financial, social and environmental information. We intend to investigatethe influence of financial performance on social and environmental disclosure and measure theintegration level of corporations that claim to publish integrated reports. The main stages of theresearch involve the determination of financial ratios and disclosure index levels for environmentaland social information. For the purpose of establishing the disclosure index we consider thereferential of GRI G3 international standards, while compliance with the standard would be theprerequisite for integrated reports, by contributing to an increase in non-financial disclosure, inaddition to the mandatory financial one. Our sample comprises 16 Asian-Pacific companies thatparticipate in the pilot program initiated by the International Integrated Reporting Committeeaccording to which organizations are encouraged to integrate their non-financial information -social and environmental disclosure - within annual reports, along with financial data. Theresearch methodology assumes computation of a disclosure index for social and environmentalinformation, and determination of financial ratios for establishing the influence of financialperformance on socio-environmental disclosure and the actual level of integration in specificintegrated reports. Our findings suggest the financial ratios can be directly, indirectly, and non-correlated with non-financial information, while the integration process is attained at high,medium, or low levels, according to the aggregation of financial, social, and environmentalinformation.",M

At the beginning of the third millennium, the role of accounting changed fundamentally,including in terms of the major intervention in collecting and treating information used to achieve anefficient management that will support the future evolution of entities, including institutions of highereducation. Accounting is called to ensure veridical and objective information for all the  actors  whoplay their role on the scene created by the university of the future, its internal and externalenvironment.As the language of business, accounting shapes information in the form of syntheses, in which financialreporting is discerned. In the public sector, the information&rsquo;s structure and content was subjected tomajor transformations, generated by the complementary of cash accounting with accrual accountingand the generalization of double entry accounting, changes that became applicable at the beginning of2006. This paper approaches aspects regarding the purpose of the accounting information processing,namely: the role of higher education institutions in supplying public capital, seen as a developmentfactor; the structure, objectives and usefulness of financial statements in the public sector; the effects ofusing the two accounting models, cash and accrual, on the quality of financial reporting.",M

There are few types of yeast in honey and the most common are Saccharomyces melis, whichgrows in media with water content over 20-25% and Saccharomyces rosei, which can ferment inmedia with 60% carbohydrates. Yeasts can produce microbiological faults in honey with more than102 cells /g honey, stored at temperatures over 15 0C (Sindilar, E., 2000). Fungi can come from dust contamination, from the water with which installations orcontainers are washed and to a smaller degree, they can come from the honeybees. If they arefound in honey in a vegetative state, they can metabolise carbohydrates, amino-acids and evenpollen, causing various organoleptic changes (taste and smell of mildew).

However, researchers working on the effectiveness of the ASEAN Free Trade Agreement have consistently reported positive trade creationary effects of AFTA. By reassessing the impact of AFTA through the Balassa method of estimating trade creation and diversion, and applying it to traditional gravity estimates, we find that (a) while ASEAN countries have spent more money per dollar earned on foreign goods in the post-AFTA period, this is generally true for all countries in the world, and (b) being a small region with significant historic trade ties, ASEAN, as a whole has always traded more amongst themselves, when compared to the world average, and this fact has been misrepresented as the trade creationary effects of AFTA. By comparing the coefficients of the regionalism dummies of ASEAN, within the scope of the gravity model, we find that there has been no significant change in these coefficients, when the sample is divided into the pre-and post-AFTA years. We thus conclude that the free trade agreement in question has had no significant impact on intra-ASEAN trade.",F

Our main conclusions include: By 2015, it is expected that average wages in China would rise by 80% thereby loosing competitiveness in labour intensive industries particularly when compared to other South East Asian countries.  These developments provide new opportunities to India to diversify and increase value-added exports to China. 30 products at HS 4 digit have been identified with potential export opportunities for India.  Of these, 7 products are globally export competitive. Most of these identified products are value added intermediaries. In addition to these, there are a number of products where Indias share in Chinas imports is less than 1%.  Most of these products fall under Electrical Machinery (85), Machinery (84), Optical equipment (90), Plastics (39) and Organic Chemicals (29). As far as market access is concerned, Tariff does not seem to emerge as a major constraint for most products except for agricultural products.

"Bibek Raychaudhuri|Debottam Chakraborty","Export Potential at the State-Level; A Case Study of Karnataka","Given the diversified framework different regions of India have different priority sectors and their requirements are different. In order to fulfill this, each region will engage in trade with different countries or other regions within India. In case of international trade, it is interesting to observe that, although any particular region (say a state) cannot individually trade with other countries, the trade basket of India, as a whole, will reflect different regional priorities of India. In this framework, it is challenging to find out the regional export potential in a country like India. Data regarding regional trade is not much accurate, since export data of regions are computed on the basis of the port-wise data. In this connection, a methodology is proposed in this paper, to estimate the regional export potential, considering Karnataka as a case. The existing production basket has been matched with the potential export items from India for this purpose. At the end, we shift our emphasis to the products which have export potential but have not yet achieved high export values. Considering tariff, non-tariff barriers and import penetration ratio for different countries we identified high, low, and medium potential products for the state from this set of products. It has been observed that some agricultural products like sunflower, groundnut, onion, turmeric, and silk, electrical machinery, precision engineering products have high unrealized export potential from the state to different countries. Identification of the basis of this unrealized export and the ways to enhance the export of such products were arrived at through the survey of various stakeholders.",F

Second, we compare Indiaâs aid allocation with that of other donors. Our findings show that Indiaâs aid allocation is partially in line with our expectations of the behavior of a âneedyâ donor. Commercial and political self-interests dominate Indiaâs aid allocation. We find the importance of political interests to be significantly larger for India than for all donors of the Development Assistance Committee. Moreover, we find that countries which are closer geographically are favored, and that countries at a similar developmental stage are more likely to enter Indiaâs aid program.",F

Compared to other businesses family businesses are characterized by two dynamic and sometimes conflicting reference systems, the family (the emotional) and the company (the professional). Succession is mentioned in the literature as one of the four main categories of problems, along with problems of strategy, of the conflicts that can arise between family members and the problems of the daily management. The management of conflict and communication frequently determine the effectiveness of the family business.The âFamily Business in the New Economy: How to Survive and Developâ (FAMBUS) project aims to develop a model for diagnosis and self-therapy (diagnostics â therapy, including conflict resolution, modernization, adoption to environment, to globalization etc.). The model aims to promoting healthy personal relationships and building high performing teams, as well as to serve as an outside resource that brings objectivity and direction to a certain situation in family businesses. It may unfold unfinished or unspoken issues and help the family business members to work toward their own unique solutions. The creation of the model is based on the results of the quantitative study (a survey comprising a structured questionnaire completed by 200 Finnish and Greek family businesses) and qualitative study (Personal site visits and interviews comprising 20 interviews in both Finland and Greece) for obtaining deeper understanding of the research problem and to support the design of the diagnosis and self-therapy model. The most important contribution of this work is anticipated to be the novel family business diagnosis and self-therapy model and subsequent electronic tool in three languages, English, Finnish and Greek, for identification of potential problem areas and potential activities for their solutions. The aim of the model is to aid family businesses to avoid difficulties at an early stage and to serve as a self-therapy model.",M

Relationships initiated, developed and maintained in this respect were studied on three Romanian companies that activate in the design and development of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) software solutions. They also deliver consultancy, implementation and post-implementation services for the products they sell. As source of information were used discutions conducted with directors of marketing from the three companies and also with several stakeholders involved in the innovation processes. Several similarities was found and described, for relationships specific to each category of stakeholder.",M

The quality of decision and the achievement of performance depend on the quality of the information supplied. That is the reason why, in order to be useful for the decision-making process, the information must be reliable, up-to-date, complete, pertinent and accessible for the decision makers.

Reverse logistics is the flow and management of products, packaging, components and information from the point of consumption to the point of origin. It is a collection of practices similar to those of supply chain management, but in the opposite direction, from downstream to upstream. It involves activities such as reuse, repair, remanufacture, refurbish, reclaim and recycle. For the conventional forward logistics systems, the flow starts upstream as raw materials, later as manufactured parts and components to be assembled and continues downstream to reach customers as final products to be disposed once they reach their economic or useful lives.

Previous research showed that the phonetic structure of brand name communicates its characteristics, i.e. it drives consumers to assess certain features and performance of the product. I assumed that when consumers encounter an unknown brand name, they automatically infer characteristics from the meaning conveyed by the sounds (e.g. phonemes). Therefore, I supposed that a brand name for a shampoo (artificially created on experimental purpose) containing back vowel is evaluated better by consumers when they compare it to another brand name with front vowels. Furthermore, for the accuracy of responses, I used the semantic differential scale to measure the differences between two brands in terms of certain attributes of product. To this end, fifty students (N=50) participated in a research based on questionnaire. As the results of the current research showed, the brand name with back vowel outnumbered the brand name with front vowel on two dimension, i.e. on brand activity and brand efficiency. The brand name containing front vowel was rated better when subjects evaluated the product in generally. Last, but not least, when it comes to convey meanings, the sound of back vowels [a] could be used more when marketers promote products that communicate its characteristics such as efficiency, velocity and health. The back vowel could be also assessed to products with larger packing or special sailing such as extra quantity.

Each of these categories generates certain types of information, and also they are complementary in the evaluation of various products, brands, organizations etc. Thus, if in a non-comparative scaling method can get information about how a product is evaluated (favorable or unfavorable, for example) by the respondents, comparative scaling method allows us to determine where that product is in a series of investigated competing products. Another aspect to be taken into account in the construction of the scales is the number of levels used. It is intended to obtain information with high degree of detail, but without the risk of increasing the rate of non-response due to inability of respondents to make assessments through scales with too many levels.

There are many channels for adolescents where they can find information about health, and sometimes these messages are contradictory. In this research I employed a qualitative approach to investigate how adolescents seek information about health through ICTs, what kind of health related topics they search on Internet, whether they rely on their peers, teachers or primary group when they are aware of being in risk, and how they assess a source as trustworthy in covering health information. Additionally, the current study surveys what it means for teenagers to be in a good physical condition, including their habits regarding self-medication, nutrition, physical activity, weight maintenance, and how they communicate with respect to the above-mentioned health-issues through ICTs. On this purpose, I conducted two focus group interviewed with 22 Romanian adolescents, aged between 12 and 17 years, who have Facebook accounts and own smartphones connected to the Internet. The main findings suggest that teenagers search the Internet to some extent as a response to factors that threaten the health condition, such as the presence of physical symptoms that are overwhelming or stressful.

Environmental concern and the current marketing strategy have spurred retailers to implement strategies to facilitate product returns from end customers. Reverse logistics, indicating the process of this return flow, encompasses such activities as the movement of returned products, facilities to accommodate returned items, and overall remedy process for returned items. The retail industry, under great competitive pressure, has used return policies as a competitive weapon. Grocery retailers were the first to begin to focus serious attention on the problem of returns and to develop reverse logistics innovations. Grocery retailers first developed innovations such as reclamation centers. Reclamation centers, in turn, led to the establishment of centralized return centers. Centralizing returns has led to significant benefits for most firms that have implemented them. Over the last several years, retailers have consolidated. Now, more than ever, reverse logistics is seen as being important. This reverse distribution activity can be crucial to the survival of companies, because the permanent goodwill of the company is at stake.

We assumed that when consumers encounter an unknown brand name, they automatically infer characteristics from the meaning conveyed by the sounds (e.g. phonemes). Therefore, we supposed that a brand name for a shampoo (artificially created on experimental purpose) containing back vowels is evaluated better by consumers when they compare it to another brand name with front vowels. Furthermore, we tested the influence of the stops and fricatives consonants in inferring certain attributes of product. To this end, fifty nine students (N=59) participated in a research based on questionnaire.

Dental healthcare services consumption is conditioned at the level of consumption motivations by complex needs which are not confined only to the physiological needs of removing pain caused by a certain dental condition, but are going towards the need of self-image improvement, increasing the appreciation offered by the others group members, the congruence with other consumers decisions within the group (family members, friends, colleagues etc). It is important to note in this context the fact that the influence exerted by consumers exogenous factors (external influences in which we can integrate those from the social groups also) will be combined with the one exerted by endogenous factors (personality, learning process, perceptions, attitudes, motivations etc), representing a continuum that shape consumers and allows in the same time the society shaping by them.

Logistics organizations must of necessity become more cost and service efficient. An understanding of the factors that affect a firms organizational effectiveness, along with strategies to reveal weaknesses or deficiencies, can help create more efficient logistics systems. Organizational changes form the basis for procedural modifications that can reduce costs or improve service. Many firms have shown significant improvements in their logistics cost-service mix as a result of organizational changes. Logistics organizations are generally structured along the following lines: strategic versus operational, centralized versus decentralized and line versus staff, in various combinations.

The analysis of innovation from a relationship establishment standpoint can only be viewed interdisciplinary at its core, with research and development, design, management, and marketing being symbiotically combined, with focus on stakeholders involvement. The paper reviwes the most significat literature in the area. There is a two-way connection between relationship marketing and innovation. On one hand, the newly launched product, conceived together with the stakeholders, is likely to generate satisfaction and, hence, customer loyalty and retention, with all known positive consequences. On the other hand, the repeated satisfaction felt by the stakeholder encourages him to expect even more from the innovative organization in what concerns the successfully launched new products. This way, the effective stakeholder involvement in the value creation process provides a strong basis for further innovation.",M
"Bogdan Nichifor","THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK OF ADVERTISING - SOME INSIGHTS","Advertising as a tool of communication, but mostly as a marketing tool is subject to many theories and explanatory and normative models. Its contents and performed functions are not yet defined in general recognized theory. Present article focuses on the analysis of advertising in terms of its specific persuasive effort and communication process. Advertising seen as a process is based on the general scheme of the marketing communication process, with a number of specific features related to its content. The persuasive effort is related to creation of favorable attitudes or reinforcing existing attitudes. This process of persuasion is closely linked to the concept of attitude. Most theories of advertising have explored the connection between persuasion and attitude, identifying possible responses that the receiver can give to advertising information. Following lines develop these two important aspects associated with advertising theory, even if they are not the only issues that are debated in the literature.",M

"Nichifor Bogdan|Barin Ioana","CONSUMERS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES VALUE PERCEPTION","This article is a theoretical approach on products and services as value satisfiers. Consumers have knowledge about the personal, symbolic values that products, services and brands help them satisfy or achieve. Values are peoples broad life goals. Values often involve the emotional affect associated with such goals and needs (the strong feelings and emotions that accompany success). Recognizing when a value has been satisfied or a basic life goal has been achieved is an internal feeling that is somewhat intangible and subjective. In contrast, functional and psychosocial consequences are more tangible and are more obvious when they occur. Salespeople add value by identifying customer needs and devising or delivering a solution for those needs. Salespeople are able to adapt how products or/and services are presented or even to adapt products/services so that they meet the needs of the buyers. Such adaption powers professional selling, because customers often dont know what they need or how to configure a solution to their needs. Satisfying a value usually elicits positive affect (happiness, joy, satisfaction), whereas blocking a value produces negative affect (frustration, anger, disappointment). Consumers can have products and services knowledge about products and services attributes, consequences of products or services use and personal values. Most marketing research focuses on one type of products and services knowledge  usually attributes or consequences, where the focus typically is on benefits rather than risks. Values are examined less frequently and usually in isolation. This paper objective is to show the importance of creating, delivering, and capturing buyer value. A companys ability to deliver value to its customers is closely tied with its ability to create satisfaction for its employees and other stakeholders. Value ultimately depends on the perceiver. Smart companies not only offer purchase value but also offer use value as well.",M

Nowadays, it is now known that international body of accounting normalization - IASB (International Accounting Standards Board), cooperates with the American body - FASB (Financial Accounting Standards Board) for the purpose of developing a Single Conceptual Framework, which is an important phase in strengthening current and future international accounting standardization process. Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting, published in September 2010 by the IASB, replaced the Framework for the Preparation and Presentation of Financial Statements issued in 1989 and is actually the result of the current process of updating the General framework of the IASB, but also represents the completion of an important stage in the process to develop a single conceptual framework.",M

At a worldwide level, there are more international or national organisms that have an important role in the elaboration of accounting standards in general and more specifically in the formulation of qualitative characteristics of financial reporting. We find two important ones among them, and these are: International Accounting Standards Board, which creates and promotes International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), and Financial Accounting Standards Board, which elaborates Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (US GAAP). However, at the level of each country a standardizing authority decides the rules for producing the financial reports and the qualitative characteristics that must be respected by the information contained in these documents. In this context, this paper aims to present a few general considerations concerning the treatment of the qualitative characteristics of the financial-accounting information in different accounting systems, such as the American one, or the British, French, German, Romanian ones, with insistence on the international approach to qualitative characteristics.",M

To accomplish its goals, the consolidated accounting uses a couple of, so-called, consolidation techniques. These are applied in the case of groups of companies with a complex structure. Their goal is to elaborate the consolidated financial statements using a set of methods and empirical skills. In this article we synthesize and apply the consolidation techniques in the view of Romanian accounting regulations. The Romanian practice has revealed, especially, two techniques: one based on direct consolidation and another one based on multiple levels (phased consolidation). Therefore, this work regards only the technical side of consolidated accounting, accounting records being evaded. Furthermore, we focus only on the preparation of the consolidated balance sheet in the case of some hypothetical groups of companies.",M

The firm's optimal choice defines a mapping from size and frequency of shipments to fixed costs per shipment. We use a unique dataset of Swiss cross-border trade on the transaction level to analyze the size and shape of the underlying fixed costs. The data suggest that for the average Swiss exporter the fixed costs per shipment are economically important&#58; about one percent of the value of export or at a net present value of 7790 CHF.

The methodological changes in the calculation of the new index have only a slight effect on the development of the nominal index.

Auditing is an essential element in the system of corporate governance. Further elements include internal control institutions and management compensation. All these elements of corporate governance are designed to reduce agency problems and information asymmetries. Therefore, interdependencies between these instruments are likely to exist. This study differs from existing research on the association between audit fees and governance institutions as it explicitly considers the German governance regime with its two-tier board system. Using data from German stock market companies, we examine whether governance elements complement or substitute the monitoring role of auditing. After adjustments for size effects, the regression results suggest that the ratio of bonus to total payments as well as the existence of an audit committee significantly lower audit fees.",M

Yusof AMINAH","BENCHMARKING THE PERFORMANCE OF MALAYSIAS CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY","Malaysias construction industry particularly the provision of public infrastructure projects faces various debatable issues of the governments belt-tightening budget, abandoned public projects, shoddy workmanship, over-budgeted project procurement and unresolved debts in public project provision.  The current global economic downturns as well as the fluctuation in the oil prices worldwide have exacerbated the situation. Thus, in materialising the efficiency, accountability for performance, productivity and monetary policy set in confronting those controversial issues, several actions have been undertaken by Malaysian government including strengthening approval procedures, restructuring the implementation process, enhancing viability through risk distribution, reinforcing the institutional and regulatory framework as well as increasing Bumiputera participation in public infrastructure projects. Yet, these endeavours seem not to be the best solution in tackling those problems. Hence, there is a need of benchmarking the performance of Malaysias construction industry especially the provision of public infrastructure projects by clearly stipulating the standard regular evaluation and audition through a performance measurement technique known as Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). This paper provides a literature review of the philosophical, conceptual and functions of KPIs in improvising Malaysias construction industry performance. The literature will guide the development of KPIs for the assessment of public infrastructure project provision in Malaysia which forms the major part of the research undertaken.",R

This study takes a closer look at the possible differences between these two customer categories. The results are explorative and based on both qualitative and quantitative studies focusing on customers actual behavior. The findings show that it is not only job-related aspects such as being able to work that influence business travel, and that private matters such as time with the family are clearly of equal significance in the choice situation. Price perception is important, but only when it is set against the appropriate social costs. The contradiction appears in the airlines offers to these customers, which are generally specifically job related. The results of the present study show that most business customers are, in fact, private customers.",M

AN IMPERIAL INVESTIGATION INTO THE RELATIONSHIP OF HOUSING AND SOCIAL EXCLUSION IN THE SLUMS OF DHAKA CITY","Slums are perceived to be heavily populated urban areas characterized by inadequate access to safe water, hygienic sanitation, urban roads, legitimate power supply, poor structural quality of housing and insecure residential status. From that perspective, slums are the clear manifestation of urban poverty. This article emphasize that slums are not just simple expression of poverty but there is a causal process that leads to poverty and inequality.  It is not a mere static state describing the inequality rather it is an outcome of structural process causing a chain of disadvantages and deprivations of the community living in the slums. In view of this, this article commences by outlining the key elements of housing in slums and through empirical findings summarises how each of these elements relate to the processes and outcomes involved in social exclusion. Findings from questionnaire interview and in-depth discussion with slum dwellers tend to lend credence to the drawing of a spatial margin of social exclusion. It is understood that slum dwellers socio-economic deprivation is closely related with housing elements that further leads to their segregation in social and economic life - thus invigorating a vicious cycle. The systematic exploitation, material deprivation leads to social and economic marginalization of the poor people and results in greater vulnerability of this marginalized group.",R

The majority of previous negotiation research has been conducted in either a western or an east vs. west environment, leading us to wonder if the findings of these studies are applicable in other cross-cultural contexts.  This study uses the dual concern model presented by Blake and Mouton (1985) to understand what drives negotiation strategy selection in two similar cultures (Taiwan and Hong Kong). The result of statistical analysis confirm significant differences in negotiation strategies between the countries: subjects in Hong Kong are more inclined to employ integration negotiation strategies while Taiwanese subjects employ more competitive strategies.",F

Moreover, the equilibrium, as a goal of territorial cohesion, aims to reduce the gaps between regions, paying a special attention to deeply disadvantaged areas. The answer of the European Union consists of the concept of polycentricity, relying on many factors, including accessibility, which in its turn relates to the territorial development. In this context, the current study aims to analyze the connectivity of Romania to other European countries using a GIS-based methodology relying on determining the orientation of roads and railroads. The results indicate that the isolation of Romania is not due to a dominant overall orientation, but due to regional differences, resulted from the configuration of relief, and constituting possible explanations of disparities in regional development. The findings sustain the importance of Romanian strategic objectives of development.",R

The online educational portal for applied foreign languages teaching and learning addressing the cross-cultural dimension represents the core of the Romanian academic research project (eMulticult), financed under the national Romanian research scheme (National Council for Project Management - Partnership Program). The present contribution summarizes the concepts and the methodology of the project, aiming at increasing professionals adaptability to a specific corporate cultural environment in order to create conditions for openness, tolerance, harmony and cooperation in the working and social environment. The studies will end up in creating  a knowledge portal for the development of adequate cultural attitudes and skills specific to a  foreign language professional environment. The project develops a holistic approach for the design of a conceptual framework based on a web educational model for foreign language acquisition and the internalization of its cultural values and the implementation of the model in a virtual environment using an adequate pedagogical approach and complex training tools. The foreign language educational model makes reference to the Andersons and Krathwohls taxonomy, articulating it with the dimensions of the specific corporate culture. The web  based paradigm and tools of the educational model will facilitate for the beneficiaries the online learning process.  The originality of this approach consists in the synergy among  various views and models such as person oriented education, multicultural approach, use of the virtual environment for providing educational services. The portal integrates educational packages for individual beneficiaries, virtual classes, formal or informal educational networks, and the tools for e-content developing.

The most praised principles regarding shareholder rights, transparency and board accountability now constitute the foundation for new tendencies evolved from such ground. Executive compensation, transparency and shareholder reporting are new issues attached to board responsibilities. Besides such almost negative approaches the board faces a more and more prominent role from risk management and IT governance perspective. Nowadays is generally acknowledged that the board is in charge for managing and controlling the risks to assets of the enterprises and business future. IT Governance has emerged as a support for corporate governance, as an important part of boards striving efforts to perform better in a competition environment. These responsibilities, risk management and IT Governance, remain within the framework of old concept of corporate governance and are fed from its substance. The interaction between these concepts is the core interest of this research.IT Governance is defined as procedures and policies established in order to assure that the IT system of an organization sustains its goals and strategies. The management of the organisations face a new challenge: structural redefinition of the IT component in order to create plus value and to minimize IT risks through an efficient management of all IT resources of the organisation.

Even if CSR points out the idea that organizations have responsibilities regarding the well-being of the entire society, it has certain limitations listed in this article. Furthermore, the authors briefly present the socio-economic impact of business organizations including (1) some basic concepts, (2) the most relevant areas/fields for measuring the impact, and (3) the main advantages regarding the development and implementation of effective impact measurement practices. The general purpose of the empirical study refers to the identification of perceptions related to the Romanian business organizations socio-economic impact. In this regard, we set the following main objectives: (1) identifying the extent to which Romanian organizations undertake a process of measuring, assessing and managing their impacts on society, (2) analyzing clients, managers and owners perceptions regarding the positive impact of seven Romanian organizations activities, and (3) identifying the perceptional differences between clients and managers plus owners. The empirical results show that in the managers plus owners opinions the areas in which the organizations activities always or almost always have a positive impact are: collecting and paying taxes, keeping a strict control over the costs, and fulfilling government regulations plus obeying laws. The highest differences in clients and managers plus owners perceptions refer to creating jobs and improving peoples personal security and the general well-being of society.",M

Although at the beginning of the sixteenth century Hungary had been transformed into a Turkish Pashalic, Transylvania retained its autonomy, thus creating favorable conditions for the development of small industries which were organized in guilds. Neither in Moldova nor in Romania did the trade restrictions and dependence on the Ottoman monopoly not lead to the disappearance of the small industries. These experienced a new development under Austrian domination in the eighteenth century in Transylvania and, a century later, Moldavia and Wallachia emerged from the Ottoman domination. This process experienced three stages: dissolution of the Ottoman trade monopoly (1829), the Union between Wallachia and Moldavia in 1859 and the independence of the country achieved in 1877. After the guilds were abolished (1873), the small industry and the big industry, though hit by the Commercial Convention between Romania and Austria-Hungary in 1876 , succeed to develop in the last decades of the nineteenth century.",M

Many research findings confirm and support being of positive effects of Internet on an enterprise's competitive advantage. In this paper, I will illustrate that enterprises can acquire relational and informational competency through Internet technology, and based on these competencies they can succeed in competitive cyber markets. According to the Internet competencies, Internet marketing strategies can be divided into five categories: Transactional, Profile, Customer-oriented, Relationship, and Knowledge strategies. Choosing and implementing any category of strategies depends on the degree of internet competencies (informational and relational) that a firm has. When both are high, proper internet marketing strategy seems to be knowledge strategies; and when both are low, transactional internet marketing strategies would be the suitable category.",M

In addition to a salary, employees may be rewarded with benefit plans, bonuses, perquisites, stock options, and other long-term incentives. The main purpose of this article is to study how rewards affect employee perceptions, attitudes, and behavior in a variety of ways. Also, the purpose of this article is to analyze how organizational efficiency and effectiveness are affected as well. The organizational concerns that are influenced by rewards, analyzed in this article, are turnover and absenteeism, performance, and commitment. In order to retain the best performers, to achieve high-levels of performance and to increase organizational commitment, managers must develop reward systems considering individual differences, integrating individual and organizational goals, designing challenging jobs.",M

This change also applies in regards with public acquisitions where legislation change implies facilitating free movement of merchandise. The means of public acquisitions which Romania was using before joining the European Union can no longer be used in the current context. Thus, current legislation must be adapted to European specific requirements while keeping the national and regional particularities. The acceptance of public-private partnership, successfully implemented in many European countries, is one direction in which public acquisition performances can be enhanced. Public-private partnership benefits derive from accepting the provider (private organization that provides goods and services) - beneficiary connection (public organization purchasing goods and services) as a partnership in which the seller-buyer relationship is seen as a win-win relationship with repetitive nature  (over a long period of time).",M

The survival capacity of a company is decisively enhanced by the quality of its moral standards. At this point the role of the human resources department could - and should - be of great substance. They must redefine themselves and their role, leading the way in pointing out the motivations that would drive to a more appropriate business culture.

It is also about the impacts of work-life balance (WLB) on the commitment and motivation of women employees in Nigeria. Thus, the main thrust of this paper is to articulate how WLB affects these variables: womens commitment and motivation in bringing about better organisational performance particularly at the turn of the millennium when organisations are in a constant flux of competition and change precipitated largely by the pressures of ascendancy of womens involvement in work-related activities, the descent of patriarchy and above all postmodernist pressure. The realities of African (Nigerian) patriarchal society have brought about serious challenges for women employees both at home and in organisations causing them to be pressured, which is largely responsible for the nature of motivation and commitment they bring to work. To this end, this paper will be exploring how to enhance (Nigerian) women employees motivation to bring about commitment for better organisational performance, given their perceived interests to get paid employment as precipitated by pressures of work-life imbalance as well as postmodernist burden to be part of providing for their families.",M

The most characteristic feature of the Jewish genocide is the bureaucratic organization and management of the feat, whereby besides the SS, state institutions and members of various groups were to varying degrees accomplices on account of their knowledge and responsibilitythe doctors who performed medical experiments; the engineers who constructed the gas chambers and crematoriums; those who participated at the highest levels of government.

In the series of frequent deficiencies is listed also what we call risk management. In order to obtain a complete success, project management presupposes, therefore, inclusively the adequate administration of the risk. In this matter, the three fundamental purposes could be: (i) identifying the probable events which could have an unwanted impact over the results; (ii) the careful and active monitoring of the identified risks; (iii) adopting certain prevention/correction measures and enforcing the internal/managerial control bound to offer full guarantees regarding the accomplishment of the pre-established objects.

This paper presents results of an exploratory study on Romanian companies aimed to provide an overview on knowledge tools in terms of reasons to implement them, problems and advantages encountered during their use or knowledge activities they are most suitable for.",M

One of them is to have employees, who are fully dedicated and committed to the objectives of a company. The degree and scope of this engagement determine the performance, social behaviors and relationships between co-workers, as well as they promote the growth of innovation and improving the financial condition of companies. Therefore, in managing modern enterprises it is important not only to use the appropriate external stimuli to motivate employees, but above all to create conditions that foster their inner motivation. The article attempts to systematize the knowledge of the theory of employee involvement and the factors determining its level as well as to analyze the issue of building the involvement of knowledge workers. The empirical study focused on the identification of instruments used to build employee engagement was applied to achieve the aforementioned research aim. The study involved 86 employees from 4 companies. The study identified a group of key conditions that, in the opinion of employees, significantly affect the degree of their involvement and contribute to the increase in the body of knowledge in the surveyed companies.",M

Events include the filing effect of financial statements made public by the SEC in preparation for an ADR program; the announcement effect of the forthcoming ADR program; and the listing effect of the first day of U.S. trading. The sample includes German firms that listed in the U.S. between 1991 and 1997. While German accounting standards allow firms to show profits when U.S. GAAP would show losses, we find that the reconciliation to U.S. GAAP reported in the filing effect is associated with positive abnormal returns. Perhaps this reflects self-selection where firms with nothing to hide list in the U.S. The announcement effects are mixed across firms. The listing effect is associated with positive abnormal returns. We also find some evidence of volume migrating from the home market to the U.S. after U.S. trading begins.",F

La metodología tiene dos etapas. En la primera etapa, se estima un índice de bienestar siguiendo una práctica extendida en la literatura especializada: análisis de componentes principales con escalamiento óptimo. En la segunda etapa, se determinan los puntos de corte del índice estimado que permiten distinguir a los hogares que califican como potenciales beneficiarios. El cálculo de los umbrales es lo novedoso de este trabajo, y se basa en la minimización de una función que depende de los errores de focalización a los que se enfrenta cualquier programa social: infiltración y subcobertura.

"Sergey Mazol","Trade policy of Belarus in the CIS region: specific model or country specific trade policy for a small open economy","The working paper critically examines trade policy of Belarus in 2006-2010 in the context of national, regional and international trends of economic activity. The paper analyses basic features of import substitution industrialization relevant for Belarus. There are summarized basic trends of Belarusâ trade, the level of country and commodity diversification of Belarusâ export and import, and the main risks and opportunities for the trade policy of Belarus. The analysis covers period of 2006-2009 when the main factors affecting present trade and trade policy of Belarus showed up. These factors include deterioration in terms of Belarusâ trade due mainly to sharp increase in the price for imported Russian natural gas and crude oil, strengthening trade discrimination by Russia against the most sensitive commodity groups, initiation of administrative reform and privatization of national champions, implementation of country diversification policy in trade to reduce risks in trade with Russia, participation in the Customs Union with Russia and Kazakhstan and consequences of global economic crisis. The trade balance deficit and pure macroeconomic performance of trade, currency policy of the Central Bank which supports real appreciation of national currency, low country diversification of trade which increases risks of economic damage coursed by protective measures of trade partners, high dependence on natural resource import to supply export production and domestic demand, deterioration in terms of Belarusâ trade with the main trade partners are among the main challenges of Belarusâ trade. The specifics of tariff and non-tariff regulations in Belarus are presented in the paper. The National strategy of import substitution and the National export development strategy, as well as basic instruments of Belarus trade policy were considered in the research. Two main options of regional trade integration for Belarus, in particular, closer integration with the CIS countries or intensified integration with the EU were taken into a consideration.",F

It provides an overall assessment of the impact of trade openness on economic growth. As a case study of such policy of trade liberalization, the new free trade agreement (FTA) between Jordan and Turkey (the most recent one) is brought into focus. It provides a comparative analysis of selected indicators of the two economies and a comprehensive analysis of the two countriesâ trade structures and directions. The current trade flows between the two countries are examined and the results used to predict expected effects of the FTA on the Jordanian economy. The study concludes with the analysis of the trade potential between the two countries.",F
"JEFF BOONE|INDER K. KHURANA|K. K. RAMAN","Audit Market Concentration and Auditor Tolerance for Earnings Management","In recent years, policy makers have expressed concern about the risks posed by audit market concentration (i.e., high market shares for the dominant Big 4 audit firms) for audit quality.  In this paper, we examine the relation between concentration at the local (i.e., metropolitan statistical area) level and auditor tolerance for earnings management during 2003-09.  Specifically, we focus our analysis on clients that met (or beat) the analysts earnings forecast but would have missed the target in the absence of positive (i.e., income-increasing) discretionary accruals.  Using a sample of clients whose earnings before performance-adjusted discretionary accruals are below the consensus analysts earnings forecast, we find higher concentration is associated with an increased likelihood of the client meeting or beating the earnings target.  Our findings hold after accounting for the effects of concentration on audit fees, the potential endogeneity of concentration, and other variables identified in the prior literature to affect audit quality.  A separate analysis of the earnings distributions for all companies covered by IBES during 2003-09 also suggests that higher concentration increases clients propensity to just beat (rather than just miss) the analysts earnings forecast.  Collectively, our findings are consistent with the misgivings expressed by policy makers, i.e., that oligopolistic dominance of the audit market by the Big 4 fosters complacency among auditors resulting in a more lenient and less skeptical approach to audits and lowers service quality",M

The number of empirical studies using the uncertainty construct also continues to be significant. However, the confusion surrounding the conceptualization and measurement of the uncertainty construct remains a subject of scholarly debate. Through our comprehensive review of 77 empirical studies over the last 20 years and related theoretical and methodological work, we intend to (1) review the conceptualization trends and persisting issues that are apparent in uncertainty research, (2) review empirical issues particularly important to uncertainty work and illustrate how researches have or have not overcome some of these challenges, and (3) suggest directions for future research using the uncertainty construct.",M
"Jeff P. Boone|Inder K. Khurana|K. K.

We address potential endogeneity in prior studies by jointly modeling abnormal accruals and litigation risk in a simultaneous equation system.  Our findings suggest that client-specific litigation risk affects auditor incentives to acquiesce to client demands for earnings management, i.e., the higher the risk of auditor litigation, the greater the auditors restraining influence on the abnormal accruals reported by the client.  We also find evidence that abnormal accruals increase the likelihood of auditor litigation.  We also document that the 1995 Public Securities Litigation Reform Act (PSLRA) lowered the client-specific risk of auditor litigation.  Litigation reform remains a topic of ongoing interest.  Our findings contribute to a better understanding of the effects of litigation reform (and related changes in legal exposure) on auditor incentives and earnings management.",M

The present research examines the alternative possibility that a brand promoted inconsistently (vs. consistently) may be evaluated more favorably because it has a higher reference price. Three studies contrasting these two explanations reveal that when consumers' reference prices for the competing brands under consideration are similar, attributions drive evaluations. However, when consumers' reference prices for the competing brands differ, reference prices drive evaluations.",M

Two studies were conducted to examine secondary control processes in older vs. younger consumers in relation to product harm crises. In both studies, older consumers perceived themselves as less vulnerable to the product harm crisis and viewed the crisis as less severe than younger consumers. Older consumers also placed less blame on the company involved in the crisis than younger consumers, and had stronger intentions to purchase and recommend products associated with the involved company in the future. These results suggest that secondary control processes in older consumers can exert an important influence on how this consumer segment interprets negative marketing events.",M

"Donald S.

It is first shown that the design of a Single Market matters: it is not just about goods markets (despite the enormous emphasis in the literature on this aspect) but also about services, labour, capital and codified technology. In order to have a Single Market function properly, it is indispensable to combine negative integration (removal of barriers) with a considerable ambition in positive integration (common regulation, selected common policies, common market institutions where appropriate and endowed with proportionate but sometimes overriding powers). The treaty contained a unique design which has been âupgradedâ with the increasing ambitions of âdeepeningâ and âwideningâ of scope of markets and policies in the EU. The development of the EU Single Market is stylized in four accomplished stages after the mid-1980s, when the âcustoms-union-plusâ was overcome for a much âdeeperâ internal market, until today.",I

A methodology is developed to calculate partial payments--or, alternatively put, to determine residual financing. By focusing on the relative seniority of creditors and expectations of the debtor's ability to repay, alternative sharing rules are quantified. The measure is based on the expected present value of payments. Creditors earning a below-market rate of return suffer a burden; creditors earning the same rate of return are said to share the burden equally.",F

We conclude that, if the variance of the expected realignment is sufficiently large, then the target zone will be useful. The second part of the paper is an empirical study that shows that the target zone regime helped reduce interest rate variability in Israel and Mexico by absorbing part of the shocks to the expected realignment with movements of the exchange rate inside the band.",F

Fixing the exchange rate reduces the wedge between the return on foreign assets and that on domestic capital, leading to an increase in the latter. After an initial real exchange rate appreciation and increase in the production of nontradables--resulting from a consumption boom--the new capital is gradually installed in the tradable sector. During this transitional period, further real appreciation takes place--as the expansion of the tradable sector pulls labor away from the nontradable sector--together with investment-driven deficits in the current account. We conclude that when appreciation and deficits are due to supply-side rigidities, rather than to credibility and/or price stickiness, no further policies (e.g., capital controls, incomes policies) are advisable.",F

The aim of this paper is to design a tool to measure institutional leadership and evaluate organizational leadership capability. Leadership came under greater focus within the institutional context at the end of the 1990s. On the one hand, this arose from the necessity to transfer leadership capabilities into the strategic assets of institutions, on the other, it is due to other approaches to management (i.e. cascading leadership, intellectual capital, organizational learning, knowledge management and self-organizing systems). The thing that unites all these approaches is their attempt to improve an organization's ability to adapt in a complex environment, and it is proposed that the ability to adapt is based on the knowledge of organizational members and to the extent that this knowledge is embedded in the pattern of organizational structure. Therefore, institutional leadership is an important issue for studying and improving the transformation of knowledge in the structure of an organization. A total of 445 respondents from six Estonian organizations participated by completing a questionnaire about institutional leadership. Next, a quantitative analysis was performed and sets of factors obtained from a partial least squares (PLS) regression and Cronbach alpha test. Finally, the pattern of individual items (statements) within each of the factors was identified and the results which indicate organizational leadership capability were plotted.",M
"Krista Jaakson|Kaarel Haav","Changes in the Concept of and Approaches to Work Satisfaction","TThe paper reviews the main changes in the concept of work satisfaction in organization theory and management practice in the last century. It particularly focuses on developments in Estonia. The author contrasts dualist and integrated concepts of employees and organizations. Most of the empirical studies focus on hedonistic individuals and ignore the social construction of identities (Shamir 1991). In such psychological framework, the dilemmas of attitude-behaviour and satisfaction-performance can not be solved. Although the role of integrated approaches is increasing (especially in theories on organizational culture and identity), the psychological paradigm still dominates, especially in the practice of traditional hierarchical organizations. The paper describes a theoretical and an empirical typology of work satisfaction, based on social (organizational) and psychological (motivational) dimensions. They were developed in Estonia in the 1970s. These typologies reveal the role of satisfaction in regulation of work activities. The author relies on social and psychological dimensions of leadership and designs a new typology of leadership styles.",M

The elasticities were estimated using the Armington (1969) model, adapted from Bilgics (2002) suggestion regarding the definition of variables. Few studies were identified in the literature that aimed at estimating elasticities of substitution in regional trade, adding relative importance to this study. This fact may be related to the generation of the database because of the non-triviality in the numerous requirements and specific information of the economy. The estimation results presented, in general, coefficients with expected signs and the elasticities changed according to the types of products. Products related to agricultural and mining activities had less elastic coefficients than the coefficients of the service activities. The products related to industrial activities presented jointly an average coefficient equal to -1.775",R

Early writers (Taussig, Viner, Dorrance) constructed variations on the relative price of traded goods that Marshall was concerned with, but most of these variations have been left behind in modern uses of the term, which today almost always refer to a relative price of exports and imports. However, when authors have wanted to identify the terms of trade with a particular country and to represent it either symbolically in an economic model or empirically, they have had to choose between defining the terms of trade as the relative price of exports or the relative price of imports. The first to do this was Taussig, who chose the second option, but he was followed by Viner who chose the first, and Viner was followed in this choice by almost all writers for the next several decades. Then, around 1980, Taussigs choice came back into fashion among scholars of international finance. I document this contrast in definitions between international trade and international finance, then add slightly to Viners argument for preferring that the terms of trade of a country be defined as the relative price of its exports.",F

This paper makes the case for a free market system in certification of quality in medical and dental care, and much else. Purpose: To explore occupational licensure as an infringement of liberty. Design/methodology/approach: a logical and empirical analysis. Findings: teeth whitening regulations serve as an anti-competitive barrier to entry. Originality/value: applying the concept of entry restrictions is not original; applying them to teeth whitening, is. This is of value in that for economic liberty to be promoted, schemes against it such as this one must be analyzed and exposed.",I

After all, given that poor people spend a disproportionate percentage of their incomes on housing, what policy could possibly be of more help to them than to lower their rents? Profit-seeking landlords can hardly be expected to do so on their own. Their inability to undertake so public-spirited a policy thus constitutes a market failure, and only government can ride to the rescue the suffering masses. This at least is the story widely told by journalists, clergy, teachers, etc. The present paper is an attempt to shed some light on the very opposite perspective: that rent controls lower the supply of residential rental housing, and thus hurt the poor, the very people supposedly helped by this unwarranted legislation.",R

The paper analyses bilateral trade patterns between India Pakistan with its major exporting destinations in a simple OLS framework. It finds that if bilateral trade between two nations increases that will improve exports of Pakistan in US, EU and UAE. This finding has significant implications for improvement of ties between the two countries. Furthermore, trading with India also full fills Pakistani Governments emphasis on Trade not Aid. This aspect of India Pakistan trade has not been investigated before.",F

The procedure of EthU included literature search, brainstorming and discussion groups to generate the preliminary pool of 99 items, refinement of the scale via a students' survey by the employment of item to total correlation and alpha if item deleted techniques. The initial scale was tested in a consumer survey conducted in the urban area of Thessaloniki, Greece. Item to total correlation and alpha if item deleted techniques were applied again, followed by Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) by the employment of PCA. The procedure left 21 items in five factors with eigenvalues greater than 1 explaining 61.34 percent of the variance. The five factors were named Boycott/ Discursive, Fair Trade, Scepticism, Powerlessness and Ineffectiveness. The AMOS SPSS was then used to conduct confirmatory factor analysis. Goodness of fit results indicated that the measurement model fit the data well (Ï square=594.226, p<0.000, CFI=0.926, NFI=0.899, TLI=0.910, RMSEA=0.066).

The aim of this study is to show that postmodernism and symbolic interactionism are fused together to delineate both the scene as well as an actor's identity. In that way, the interaction of a social structure with a culture that won't be completely ignored, and, with the opinion that the categorized roles can skillfully be shaped and diversified by actors, it is possible to refrain from a pure determinism. But the transformation to enter different roles lacks meaning. Individuals pay more attention to their appearance more than who they are in order to be accepted by each group. In this manner, a metaphysical shell game begins. In the following study, the 'Social Appearance Anxiety' was used as an indicator of this game.  And to determine who is willing to play the game, cultural parameters were utilized.",M

Bordo|Marc Flandreau","Core, Periphery, Exchange Rate Regimes, and Globalization","In this Paper we focus on the different historical regime experiences of the core and the periphery. Using conventional Feldstein-Horioka tests, but taking a more careful look at the panel properties of our sample, this Paper reports results which are consistent with the âFolkâ wisdom that financial integration was as high before 1914 as it is today. But the evidence suggests that it was not the exchange rate regime followed that mattered for deeper integration but the presence of capital controls. Moreover, we find that the financial integration observed for the recent period is truly an advanced country phenomenon, suggesting that the causality goes from globalization to the exchange rate regime rather than the other way round. We develop this intuition by showing that before 1914, advanced countries adhered to gold while periphery countries either emulated the advanced countries or floated. Some peripheral countries were especially vulnerable to financial crises and debt default in large part because of their extensive external debt obligations denominated in core country currencies. This left them with the difficult choice of floating but restricting external borrowing or devoting considerable resources to maintaining an extra hard peg. Today while advanced countries can successfully float, emergers, who are less financially mature and must borrow abroad in terms of advanced country currencies, are afraid to float for the same reason as their 19th century forbearers. To obtain access to foreign capital they may need a hard peg to the core country currencies, or else can resort to capital controls. Thus the key distinction between the exchange rate regime of core and periphery countries both then and now that we emphasize in this Paper is financial maturity, evidenced in the ability to issue international securities denominated in domestic currency.",F

It uses the Eurobarometer public opinion surveys published by the European Commission, which provide data on the share of the population in each EU15 member country in favour of each CEEC joining the EU. Our results first suggest that bilateral opinions have a statistically robust and relatively large effect on imports, even when standard and new covariates capturing proximity between countries are controlled for. We interpret this effect as reflecting a positive impact of âbilateral affinityâ on trade patterns. We also show that it is possible to go some way towards explaining the variance in bilateral opinions among our sample. Last we provide some preliminary attempt to determine causality between bilateral opinions and imports.",F

Ce retour de la croissance fut principalement initiÃ© par le commerce extÃ©rieur â notamment en Allemagne et aux Pays-Bas â et par la contribution des stocks (en France et en Italie) tandis que la demande intÃ©rieure peine Ã  retrouver un dynamisme en raison dâune consommation atone et dâun ajustement de lâinvestissement qui nâest toujours pas terminÃ©. Tous les pays nâont cependant pas repris le chemin de la croissance puisque lâEspagne et lâIrlande Ã©taient encore en rÃ©cession fin 2009. En outre, les difficultÃ©s budgÃ©taires rencontrÃ©es par la GrÃ¨ce pourraient plonger la zone euro dans une nouvelle crise, sans doute plus institutionnelle que politique. Enfin, la croissance du PIB est encore insuffisante pour entraÃ®ner une amÃ©lioration de lâemploi, dâautant que les entreprises en profitent essentiellement pour redresser leur productivitÃ© qui avait fortement baissÃ© â sauf en Espagne â au plus fort de la crise. De fait, le taux de chÃ´mage a crÃ» de 0,6 point au cours du deuxiÃ¨me semestre 2009 pour atteindre 9,9 %. La stabilisation prendrait encore quelques trimestres et en 2011, le taux de chÃ´mage toucherait encore 10,3 % de la population active.

We find a statistically significant positive trend in cross-market correlations between 1999 and 2008, before the emergence of the global financial crisis. Movements in national stock markets are not fully synchronized, but increases in market volatilities lead to increases in cross-country correlations. There is a long-term relationship between some of these countries capital markets, and information is transmitted from one market to the other. Our findings confirm previous studies and lead to the conclusion that stock markets from Central and Eastern Europe became more integrated with the developed markets in European Union.",F

The attractiveness of an organization towards potential and actual employees is therefore an issue which is of broad interest for general management as it plays an increasing role to reach companys aims. Necessary for creating such an attractiveness as employer are the establishment of substantiated processes of acquiring and retaining employees. The objective of this paper is to assess whether the application of a companys human resource managements marketing approach has an impact on employee satisfaction. Concerning the research methods causal modelling and triangulation of research are used. Quantitative research is applied. Results show that the better a companys human resource managements marketing approach in terms of its quality and performance is, the higher is the employees perception about their employers organization as well as the overall employees satisfaction. Findings also reveal a significant positive relationship between a high quality of human resource managements marketing approach and employee satisfaction. Furthermore, a positive relation between a high performance of human resource managements marketing approach and the classification of a companys brand awareness on the labor market as well as a companys classification into an employer of choice is found. Thus, it can be concluded that human resource managements marketing approach is a viable process in the realm of human resource management to steer a companys success through a focus on employee satisfaction.",M

Albeit their socio-economic value added, prior research shows that the sustainability of these business are among the worst in the world, since approximately 70% of South African SMMEs fail within their first three years of existence. This dispensation is often blamed on inter alia, their inadequate management of economic factors which, in turn, cultivates risks. Notwithstanding the fact that most South African SMMEs make use of customised risk management initiatives, previous research shows that these initiatives are not deemed as adequate and/or effective to mitigate risks. Since the manner in which risks are managed are strongly dependent on the attitude and awareness of its management surrounding internal control (control environment), this study focused on investigating whether the control environment was used as foundation to implement their customised risk management initiatives. Empirical research was conducted whereby primary quantitative data were collected from respondents through the deployment of a questionnaire, through means of non-probability sampling methods. The results showed that though the control environments of South African SMMEs were regarded as good, they were not used as foundation by South African SMMEs to implement their customised risk management initiatives.",M

Here SMMEs are defined as small business entities that are managed by one or more owner(s) while operating in any sector or sub-sector of the national economy. The main roles of SMMEs are to alleviate poverty, reduce unemployment and uplift the South African economy. South African SMMEs are responsible for employing more than half of the national workforce and are believed to contribute up to 34.8% towards the national Gross Domestic Product. Unfortunately an estimated 80% of South African SMMEs fail within their first 5 years of existence; particularly due to the realisation of micro economic factors and macroeconomic factors. Included in micro economics factors which influence SMMEs is the utilisation of formal financial performance measures. For this research study the main objective of this paper was to establish the extent to which cash budgets (a formal financial performance measure) assist SMME leaders to make sound business decisions in the Cape Metropolis. The study was descriptive in nature and quantitative research methods were used to collect data from 51 SMME leaders. All respondents had to adhere to a set of pre-determined delineation criteria. From the analysed data it is evident that SMME leaders (managers and/or owners) regard cash budgets as important to make sound business decisions however, respondents made limited use thereof.",M

Within enterprises, strategy blindness could be affected by mistranslation of strategic intent, flexibility of the information system, or cognitive entrenchment. The alignment between business strategy and business processes is a critical factor in the ability of enterprises to overcome the phenomenon. Opportunities for value creation include magnifying the positive spread in cash flow or pursuing growth opportunities. Information systems could greatly simplify the processes involved in business strategy by integrating process-related decision-making with the business strategy. Decision support tools such as knowledge management, decision strategy, decision content, and expert groups, customised for organisational information systems can help enterprises optimise operations in a variety of ways such as becoming more responsive to changing market conditions in hypercompetitive markets. Greatest opportunities for decision support are incorporating external sources of data such as economic data and user behaviour analytics.

Because of the difficulty of having a frame for the mobile-service customers from their providers, a convenience sample of 350 online respondents with the proper surveying techniques was used in data analysis and testing of the research hypotheses. The findings of the study confirm a significant negative relationship between customer satisfaction and brand switching intention. A 4% percent of the change in brand switching intention could be explained by the change in the customer satisfaction. Only three variables; customer service, service pricing, and service quality are critical determinants for mobile-service customer satisfaction. Customer service explained about 22%, whereas service pricing and service quality explained about 5% and 1% of the change in customer satisfaction respectively. The practical value of this study could be enabling the mobile-service providers in Saudi Arabia to well understand the determinants of the customer satisfaction and its negative relationship with brand switching intention. They may take these findings into account when setting marketing strategies to differentiate their brands to satisfy the customer needs and wants, to retain the existing customers and to attract new customers. These strategies have a positive effect on the companys customer satisfaction that deter brand switching intention, hence increase the companys competitiveness, market share and profitability.",M

It is believed that the traditional value proposition is no longer effective to compete in the market and to gain customer loyalty. By adapting the brand experience model, this study tries to validate the model in the banking industry, which is currently facing intense competition to retain customers. The brand experience construct is tested for its direct and indirect relationship toward loyalty. It is postulated that satisfaction and brand authenticity might be instrumental in mediating brand experience to loyalty. Research was conducted via in-depth interview and quantitative survey, targeting bank customers in Jakarta. The result confirmed that brand experience has direct and indirect contribution to loyalty in significant and positive manner. The research contributes in validating previous studies with a rare emphasis in banking sector.

This is why the field of online reselling appears increasingly important. Besides, the ever broadening scope of online reselling is key to the success of new online intermediaries that position themselves in the broader movement of collaborative consumption. While, consumers attachment for second-hand exchanges is not new, they have largely embraced its online declination. In response to these evolutions in the online retail environment, traditional retail companies have therefore started to create online consumer marketplaces in which consumers exchange goods by themselves. In order to best adapt such online marketplaces to consumers, it is therefore critically important to gain a better understanding of the driving forces behind online reselling. At present, knowledge about what motivates consumers to resell products online is limited. This article outlines the development and validation process of an online resale motivation (ORM) scale via three studies involving 1,119 respondents. Study 1 presents the ORM scale development process and resulting multi-dimensional construct, including protester, economic, generative, recreational, practical and social facets. Study 2 replicates the scale and investigates its predictive capabilities. More specifically, the ORM scale predicts successfully online resale frequency. Consumers who are more highly motivated to resell online, will indeed resell more often online. Study 3 examines the mediating role of ORM on the relationship between planned resale intentions (PRI) and online resale behaviour. The fact that consumers plan to resell a product prior to its purchase, will not directly lead them to increase the frequency at which they resell online. Rather, it is because they perceive positive economic, practical and recreational outcomes associated with online reselling that they resell more frequently online the goods which they intended to resell prior to their purchase.",M

This paper presents the examination of the responses of 154 tourists in relation to their intention to purchase a travel package and the factors that are usually decisive in the decision making process regarding tourism services, factors that could also create the loyalty that any tourism enterprise can create through marketing.",M

Ultimately, companies should be interested in consumer perceptions and the factors that play a role in following a certain behavior over an extended period of time.  Attaining a successful marketing program compels companies to fully connect with their targeted customers. Therefore, this paper aims to propose a new model that examines relationships between cognitive  affective  conative constructs in an e-shopping environment.",M
"Alin OPREANA","Examining Online Shopping Services in Relation to Experience and Frequency of Using Internet Retailing","E-shopping has the potential to replace traditional in-store shopping. It is well perceived that information and communication technologies have great impacts on modern society - they are changing how and where we work, shop, and in general terms how we live our lives. In this study, we use a survey instrument to examine the association between experience level with Internet and e-shopping and consumers frequency of online purchasing, while considering sex as a passive influencer. We study these relationships in a multinomial logistic regression model that is aimed at online retailers to help them improve their understanding of their consumers characteristics and propensity to buy through Internet retailing. Tracking the online journey of consumers will help enhance the attractiveness of this new retailing medium to current and potential customers.",M

Consumer researchers have increasingly begun to investigate consumer choice based on distinctions that involve the purchase and consumption of goods for pleasure versus for more utilitarian and instrumental purposes. Consumers are often faced with these types of choices between hedonic and utilitarian alternatives that are at least partly driven by emotional desires rather than cold cognitive deliberations. This research approaches factor analysis and multiple linear regression in the context of 150 international respondents and their perception of hedonic and utilitarian motivators on likelihood to buy a tourism package.",M

"Rubinstein, Yona|Weiss, Yoram","Post Schooling Wage Growth: Investment, Search and Learning","The survey presents basic facts on wage growth and summarizes the main ideas on the possible sources of this growth. We document that wage growth happens mainly early in the life cycle and is then associated with increasing labor force participation and high job mobility. Wage growth during the first decade in the labor market, is about 50% for high school graduates and about 80% for those with college or more. This growth is comparable in size to the accumulated contribution of schooling for these two groups. We describe in detail models of wage growth that can explain these results, including investment in human capital, search and learning. We also discuss the roles of contracts in sharing the risks associated with learning about ability and varying market conditions. Evidence supporting investment is the U shaped life cycle profile for the variance of wages. However, heterogeneity matters and individuals with relatively high life time earnings have both a higher mean and a higher growth. Evidence supporting search is the high wage gains obtained from changing employers early in the career. Evidence for learning are the initially rising hazard of quitting and the rising rewards for AFQT scores that are not observed by the market.",I
"Black, Sandra E.|Sokoloff, Kenneth L.","Long-Term Trends in Schooling: The Rise and Decline (?) of Public Education in the United States","In recent decades, there has been rising anxiety about the quality of the public education in the United States. However, it is important to note that this has not always been the case; in fact, the United States has long been a leader in terms of the public provision of education at all levels of schooling. This chapter documents this history, describing the conditions in the early years of the country that were conducive to the rise of universal public education, in particular the relative homogeneity of the population and the local nature of the provision of public education. These factors increased local support and enabled the educational system to be responsive to local needs. In more recent history, however, there has been substantial change in the demographics of the United States; this chapter also explores how well the public education system has been able to adapt to these changes.",I

Finally, the recent literature suggests than any concern that educational generational progress among Latino immigrants has lagged behind other immigrant groups is largely unfounded.",I
"Peracchi, Franco","Educational Wage Premia and the Distribution of Earnings: An International Perspective","This chapter analyzes the international evidence on the relationship between educational wage premia and the distribution of personal labor earnings. The aim is to review what is known about the contribution of differences in relative wages across schooling levels to the degree of variability, between countries and over time, in the pecuniary returns to work. Definition and measurement problems are of paramount importance in analyses of this kind, and so a large part of the chapter is devoted to some of these issues.",I
"Deere, Donald R.|Vesovic, Jelena","Educational Wage Premiums and the U.S. Income Distribution: A Survey","his chapter discusses the large literature and numerous issues regarding education-related differences in income in the U.S. Early analyses of skill-related differences compared the earnings of workers across occupations. The general consensus of these investigations was that skill premiums narrowed substantially between 1900 and 1950. The large increase in the supply of high-school graduates relative to the increased demand for skilled workers is the likely explanation. Following the 1940 Decennial Census, which collected information on educational attainment and on earned income and time worked, empirical analyses concentrated directly on education-related differences in earnings. The human capital revolution of the late 1950s/early 1960s greatly expanded the research on education and income and shifted the focus to wages. The human capital approach modeled income as endogenous and sought to understand the variation in earnings by providing a framework for estimating the returns to education and experience. Recent analyses of education and wages have built on this foundation and have been embedded in a large literature that seeks to document and understand the substantial increase in wage inequality over the last 40 years. The consensus is that increases in the demand for skill are the main culprit, though the reasons for such increases are still an open question. We use census data to document the overall increase in education-related income differences over the past 60 years for several income measures. We also document concomitant changes in enrollment and provide a preliminary analysis suggesting that enrollment has responded to the increase in education-wage premiums. We use NLSY data to document the variation in enrollment patterns for those who attend college and to show how these differences are related to pre-schooling characteristics and to post-schooling earnings. We conclude with a brief discussion of the main issues for future research raised throughout the chapter.",I
"Heckman, James J.|Lochner, Lance J.|Todd, Petra E.","Earnings Functions, Rates of Return and Treatment Effects: The Mincer Equation and Beyond","Numerous studies regress log earnings on schooling and report estimated coefficients as Mincer rates of return. A more recent literature uses instrumental variables. This chapter considers the economic interpretation of these analyses and how the availability of repeated cross section and panel data improves the ability of analysts to estimate the rate of return. We consider under what conditions the Mincer model estimates an ex post rate of return. We test and reject the model on six cross sections of U.S. Census data. We present a general nonparametric approach for estimating marginal internal rates of return that takes into account tuition, income taxes and forms of uncertainty. We also contrast estimates based on a single cross-section of data, using the synthetic cohort approach, with estimates based on repeated cross-sections following actual cohorts. Cohort-based models fitted on repeated cross section data provide more reliable estimates of ex post returns.",I
"Lange, Fabian|Topel, Robert","The Social Value of Education and Human Capital","We review and extend the empirical literature that seeks evidence of a wedge between the private and social returns to human capital, specifically education. This literature has two main strands. First, much of modern growth theory puts human capital at center-stage, building on older notions of human capital externalities as an engine of economic growth. Empirical support for these ideas, based on both the comparative growth of national outputs and on the geographic dispersion of wages within countries, is meager. There is a strong association between average earnings and average education across nations and regions in the U.S. that exceeds the private returns to education. However, problems of omitted variables and endogeneity inherent in spatial equilibrium models mean that this association can hardly be understood as evidence for social returns. There is no evidence from this literature that social returns are smaller than private ones, yet neither is there much to suggest that they are larger. We then turn to the literature on job market signaling, which implies that social returns to education are smaller than private returns. Consistent with our earlier conclusions, we find scant evidence of this. We construct a model of the speed of employer learning about workers' unobserved talents, and we estimate the model using panel data on young workers. We find that employer learning about productivity occurs fairly quickly after labor market entry, implying that the signaling effects of schooling are small.",I
"Neal, Derek","Why Has Black-White Skill Convergence Stopped?","All data sources indicate that black-white skill gaps diminished over most of the 20th century, but black-white skill gaps as measured by test scores among youth and educational attainment among young adults have remained constant or increased in absolute value since the late 1980s. I examine the potential importance of discrimination against skilled black workers, changes in black family structures, changes in black household incomes, black-white differences in parenting norms, and education policy as factors that may contribute to the recent stability of black-white skill gaps. Absent changes in public policy or the economy that facilitate investment in black children, best case scenarios suggest that even approximate black-white skill parity is not possible before 2050, and equally plausible scenarios imply that the black-white skill gap will remain quite significant throughout the 21st century.",I
"Grossman, Michael","Education and Nonmarket Outcomes","This chapter explores the effects of education on nonmarket outcomes from both theoretical and empirical perspectives. Examples of outcomes considered include general consumption patterns at a moment in time, savings and the rate of growth of consumption over time, own (adult) health and inputs into the production of own health, fertility, and child quality or well-being reflected by their health and cognitive development. They are distinguished from the labor market outcomes of education in terms of higher earnings and wage rates. The focus is on identifying causal effects of education and on mechanisms via which these effects operate. The chapter pays a good deal of attention to the effects of education on health for a variety of reasons. They are the two most important sources of human capital: knowledge capital and health capital. They interact in their levels and in the ways they affect the cost and usefulness of the other. There is a large literature addressing the nature of their complementarities. While each affects the production and usefulness of the other, there are important dynamics of their interaction, seen in the age-structure of the net and gross production of the two. This sequencing also affects their optimal amounts. In the conceptual foundation section, models in which education has productive efficiency and allocative efficiency effects are considered. These frameworks are then modified to allow for the endogenous nature of schooling decisions, so that observed schooling effects can be traced in part to omitted third variables such as an orientation towards the future. An additional complication is that schooling may contribute to a future orientation in models with endogenous preferences. The empirical review provides a good deal of evidence for the proposition that the education effects are causal but is less conclusive with regard to the identification of specific mechanisms.",I
"Pritchett, Lant","Does Learning to Add up Add up? The Returns to Schooling in Aggregate Data","The theoretical, conceptual, and practical difficulties with the use of cross-national data on schooling are so severe using aggregate data for any purpose for which individual level data would do should be avoided. There are, however, three questions for which the use of cross-national data on schooling could potentially help answer interesting questions for which individual data is insufficient. First, do differences in the evolution and dynamics of schooling help explain the big facts about the evolution and dynamics of output growth? Largely, no. Second, the existence and magnitude of output externalities to schooling is an important question with possible normative policy implications, and evidence for externalities requires at least some level of spatial aggregation. Does the cross-national data provide support for output externalities? Largely, no. Third, cross-national (or more broadly spatially aggregated) data allows the exploration of the impact on returns to schooling (or in the gap between private and social returns) of differences in economic environments. This last question seems a promising line for future research.",I
"Cunha, Flavio|Heckman, James J.|Lochner, Lance","Interpreting the Evidence on Life Cycle Skill Formation","This paper presents economic models of child development that capture the essence of recent findings from the empirical literature on skill formation. The goal of this essay is to provide a theoretical framework for interpreting the evidence from a vast empirical literature, for guiding the next generation of empirical studies, and for formulating policy. Central to our analysis is the concept that childhood has more than one stage. We formalize the concepts of self-productivity and complementarity of human capital investments and use them to explain the evidence on skill formation. Together, they explain why skill begets skill through a multiplier process. Skill formation is a life cycle process. It starts in the womb and goes on throughout life. Families play a role in this process that is far more important than the role of schools. There are multiple skills and multiple abilities that are important for adult success. Abilities are both inherited and created, and the traditional debate about nature versus nurture is scientifically obsolete. Human capital investment exhibits both self-productivity and complementarity. Skill attainment at one stage of the life cycle raises skill attainment at later stages of the life cycle (self-productivity). Early investment facilitates the productivity of later investment (complementarity). Early investments are not productive if they are not followed up by later investments (another aspect of complementarity). This complementarity explains why there is no equity-efficiency trade-off for early investment. The returns to investing early in the life cycle are high. Remediation of inadequate early investments is difficult and very costly as a consequence of both self-productivity and complementarity.",I
"Speakman, Robert|Welch, Finis","Using Wages to Infer School Quality","This chapter examines the literature that attempts to measure the relationship between labor earnings and the average quality of a state's elementary and secondary schools where school quality is approximated by statewide average characteristics like the teacher-pupil ratio.

Even so, we include an annotated bibliography of the various papers that have addressed this topic.",I
"Hanushek, Eric A.","School Resources","Although there is intense policy interest in improving educational outcomes around the world, there is much greater uncertainty about how to accomplish this. The primary governmental decisions often relate to the resources that are devoted to schooling, but the research indicates little consistent relationship between resources to schools and student achievement. Much of the research considers how resources affect student achievement as measured by standardized test scores. These scores are strongly related to individual incomes and to national economic performance, making them a good proxy for longer run economic impacts. But, the evidence - whether from aggregate school outcomes, econometric investigations, or a variety of experimental or quasiexperimental approaches - suggests that pure resource policies that do not change incentives are unlikely to be effective. Importantly, the results appear similar across both developed and developing countries.",I
"Bishop, John","Drinking from the Fountain of Knowledge: Student Incentive to Study and Learn - Externalities, Information Problems and Peer Pressure","Students face four decision margins: (a) How many years to spend in school, (b) What to study, (c) How much effort to devote to learning per year and (d) Whether to disrupt or assist the learning of classmates. The thousands of studies that have applied human capital theory to the first two questions are reviewed elsewhere in this volume and the Handbook series. This chapter reviews an emerging economic literature on the effects of and determinants of student effort and cooperativeness and how putting student motivation and behavior at center of one's theoretical framework changes one's view of how schools operate and how they might be made more effective. In this new framework students have a dual role. They are both (a) investors/consumers who choose which goals (outputs) to focus on and how much effort to put into each goal and (b) workers getting instruction and guidance from their first-line supervisors, the teachers. A simple model is presented in which the behavior of students, teachers and administrators depends on the incentives facing them and the actions of the other actors in the system. The incentives, in turn, depend upon the cost and reliability of the information (signals) that is generated about the various inputs and outputs of the system. Our review of empirical research support many of the predictions of the model.",I
"Glewwe, Paul|Kremer, Michael","Schools, Teachers, and Education Outcomes in Developing Countries","About 80% of the world's children live in developing countries. Their well-being as adults depends heavily on the education they receive. School enrollment rates have increased dramatically in developing counties since 1960, but many children still leave school at a young age and often learn little while in school. This chapter reviews recent research on the impact of education and other policies on the quantity and quality of education obtained by children in developing countries. The policies considered include not only provision of basic inputs but also policies that change the way that schools are organized. While much has been learned about how to raise enrollment rates, less is known about how to increase learning. Randomized studies offer the most promise for understanding the impact of policies on learning.",I
"Rivkin, Steven|Welch, Finis","Has School Desegregation Improved Academic and Economic Outcomes for Blacks?","A half a century has passed since the landmark decision Brown v. Board of Education (1954) overturned the doctrine of separate but equal in the realm of public education. This chapter attempts to summarize what we know about the impact of Brown on enrollment patterns and academic and economic outcomes for blacks. There can be little doubt that the decisions in Brown and several subsequent cases dramatically altered public education in the US. From 1968 to 1980 there is an almost 67 percent increase in the average percentage of blacks' schoolmates who are white in the US as a whole and a whopping 130 percent increase in the south despite the efforts of many whites to avoid the newly integrated schools. The discontinuous nature of the white enrollment changes following the implementation of desegregation programs provides strong evidence of a causal link between desegregation and white enrollment declines. Not surprisingly, programs that require student participation and urban areas with larger numbers of alternative school districts appear to evoke a larger enrollment response. This responsiveness along with other factors that determine the choices of neighborhoods and schools complicate efforts to identify desegregation program and racial composition effects on academic, social, and labor market outcomes. The evidence on school demographic composition indicates that expanded inter-racial contact improves both academic and labor market outcomes for blacks. There is less evidence on desegregation program effects, and existing evidence is mixed. In recent years demographic changes across the nation have reduced the average share of blacks' classmates who are white despite the fact that segregation of blacks from whites has declined in all regions since 1980 except in the south, where the increase has been small. Importantly, it is the sorting of families among communities rather than districts' allocations of students among schools that limit the extent of inter-racial contact in the schools.",I
"Hanushek, Eric A.|Rivkin, Steven G.","Teacher Quality","Improving the quality of instruction is a central component to virtually all proposals to raise school quality. Unfortunately, policy recommendations often ignore existing evidence about teacher labor markets and the determinants of teacher effectiveness in the classroom. This chapter reviews research on teacher labor markets, the importance of teacher quality in the determination of student achievement, and the extent to which specific observable characteristics often related to hiring decisions and salary explain the variation in the quality of instruction. The evidence is applied to the comparison between policies that seek to raise quality by tightening the qualifications needed to enter teaching and policies that seek to raise quality by simultaneously loosening entry restrictions and introducing performance incentives for teachers and administrators.",I

It also provides suggests for fruitful areas of future research.",I
"Blau, David|Currie, Janet","Pre-School, Day Care, and After-School Care: Who's Minding the Kids?","The majority of children in the US and many other high-income nations are now cared for many hours per week by people who are neither their parents nor their school teachers. The role of such pre-school and out-of-school care is potentially two-fold: First, child care makes it feasible for both parents or the only parent in a single-parent family to be employed. Second, early intervention programs and after school programs aim to enhance child development, particularly among disadvantaged children. Corresponding to this distinction, there are two branches of literature to be summarized in this chapter. The first focuses on the market for child care and analyzes factors affecting the supply, demand and quality of care. The second focuses on child outcomes, and asks whether certain types of programs can ameliorate the effects of early disadvantage. The primary goal of this review is to bring the two literatures together in order to suggest ways that both may be enhanced. Accordingly, we provide an overview of the number of children being cared for in different sorts of arrangements; describe theory and evidence about the nature of the private child care market; and discuss theory and evidence about government intervention in the market for child care. Our summary suggests that additional research is needed in order to better characterize interactions between government programs and market-provided child care.",I
"Fischel, William A.","The Courts and Public School Finance: Judge-Made Centralization and Economic Research","This paper explores for economists how the school-finance litigation movement, which began with Serrano v. Priest in 1971, ought to be characterized in economic models. Its primary message is that this has become a national movement, not one confined to individual states. Economists should be wary of characterizing these cases as discrete events in which a state that loses to reform-minded plaintiffs is distinctly different from a state that succeeds in defending its system. I describe numerous instances in which states have attempted to head off defeat in the courts by conceding to reform-demands by the plaintiffs. School finance litigation does make a difference, however. Win or lose, states have been induced to reformulate their state-aid formulas. I show that the most common of these reforms, which focus on differences in tax-base per pupil, have altered the local tax price for education. This alteration causes the property rich districts to pay more for education. However, the correlation between property rich and income rich is essentially zero, largely because low-income communities are more willing to tolerate the nonresidential uses that lower their tax price. The result is that school-finance reform in most states is likely to reduce the efficiency of local public education because of tax-price distortion but not improve the lot of low-income students and taxpayers in any systematic way.",I
"Nechyba, Thomas J.","Income and Peer Quality Sorting in Public and Private Schools","Any system of primary and secondary schools involves explicit or implicit mechanisms that ration not only financial but also nonfinancial inputs into education production. This chapter focuses primarily on such mechanisms as they relate to the sorting of parents and children into schools and classrooms. Three primary mechanisms are reviewed: (1) sorting that emerges through residential location choices within housing markets that are linked to schools; (2) sorting that arises from parental choices to send children to private rather than public schools; and (3) sorting within schools that results from explicit tracking policies. The equilibrium level of sorting (along parental income and child peer quality dimensions) then depends on both the specifics of how education production works and the overall characteristics of the general equilibrium environment within which schools operate. We review the theoretical as well as the related simulation-based literature in this area and suggest that much potential exists for increasing empirical relevance of the emerging models for policy analysis, particularly as a related empirical literature comes to better terms with the nature of peer effects in education production.",I

Student financial aid, a feature of growing importance, is awarded to students on the basis both of financial need and academic (and other) merit, with merit influencing not only total amounts of aid received but also the quality of aid packages, as indexed by the fraction of aid in the form of grants rather than loans or work.",I
"Chapman, Bruce","Income Contingent Loans for Higher Education: International Reforms","It is well known that higher education financing involves uncertainty and risk with respect to students' future economic fortunes, and an unwillingness of banks to provide loans because of the absence of collateral.

The historically most common response to this market failure - a government guarantee to repay student loans to banks in the event of default - is associated with significant problems.",I
"Meghir, Costas|Rivkin, Steven","Econometric Methods for Research in Education","This paper reviews some of the econometric methods that have been used in the economics of education. The focus is on understanding how the assumptions made to justify and implement such methods relate to the underlying economic model and the interpretation of the results. We start by considering the estimation of the returns to education both within the context of a dynamic discrete choice model inspired by Willis and Rosen (1979) and in the context of the Mincer model. We discuss the relationship between the econometric assumptions and economic behavior. We then discuss methods that have been used in the context of assessing the impact of education quality, the teacher contribution to pupils' achievement, and the effect of school quality on housing prices. In the process we also provide a summary of some of the main results in this literature.",I
"Hanushek, Eric A.|Woessmann, Ludger","The Economics of International Differences in Educational Achievement","An emerging economic literature over the past decade has made use of international tests of educational achievement to analyze the determinants and impacts of cognitive skills. The cross-country comparative approach provides a number of unique advantages over national studies: It can exploit institutional variation that does not exist within countries; draw on much larger variation than usually available within any country; reveal whether any result is country-specific or more general; test whether effects are systematically heterogeneous in different settings; circumvent selection issues that plague within-country identification by using system-level aggregated measures; and uncover general-equilibrium effects that often elude studies in a single country. The advantages come at the price of concerns about the limited number of country observations, the cross-sectional character of most available achievement data, and possible bias from unobserved country factors like culture.",I

"Sacerdote, Bruce","Peer Effects in Education: How Might They Work, How Big Are They and How Much Do We Know Thus Far?","This chapter summarizes the recent literature on peer effects in student outcomes at the elementary, secondary, and post-secondary levels. Linear-in-means models find modest sized and statistically significant peer effects in test scores. But the linear-in-means model masks considerable heterogeneity in the effects experienced by different types of students. Using nonlinear models, one prevalent finding is larger peer effects in which high ability students benefit from the presence of other high ability students. Studies that stratify students by race and ability often find that students are affected both by the racial composition of their peers and by the achievement of their same-race peers. At the university level, several studies find modest sized effects from dormmate and roommate background on own academic performance. For both university and high school students, the measured peer effects on social outcomes such as drinking are larger than the effects on academic outcomes. Many authors find substantial peer effects in drinking, drug use, and criminal behavior. This chapter suggest areas for future investigation and data collection.",I
"Podgursky, Michael","Teacher Compensation and Collective Bargaining","While compensation accounts for roughly 90% of K-12 instructional costs, there is little evidence of rational design in these systems.

Since these compensation schemes typically arise out of collective negotiations, this chapter also surveys the smaller literature on the effect of teacher collective bargaining on earnings and school outcomes.",I
"Goldhaber, Dan","Licensure: Exploring the Value of this Gateway to the Teacher Workforce","Empirical research bears out the conventional wisdom that teacher quality is the key schooling resource influencing student achievement, so it is not surprising that policy makers attempt to influence it by regulating admission into the teacher labor market through licensure systems. Most of these systems require teachers to graduate from an approved teacher training institution and pass one or more tests, the notion being that these preservice requirements ensure a basic level of teacher competence. A criticism, however, is that these requirements dissuade talented individuals from attempting to become teachers, thereby lowering the quality of teachers in the workforce. It is shocking how little we actually know about key aspects of the teacher licensure-teacher quality equation. The great majority of the empirical literature on licensure speaks to one crucial link in the teacher licensure-teacher quality equation: the correlation between licensure requirements and student achievement. In general this literature suggests only weak links between specific licensure requirements and student achievement. Far less evidence exists on the impact of licensure on the pool of potential teachers, or who school district hiring officials would employ in the face of fewer requirements, or the absence of requirements altogether.",I
"Betts, Julian R.","The Economics of Tracking in Education","Tracking refers to the practice of dividing students by ability or achievement. Students may be tracked within schools by placing them into different classrooms based on achievement, which is the typical practice in countries such as the United States or Canada. Alternatively, students could be streamed into different schools, with either vocational or academic emphases, as has been practiced commonly in Europe. Proponents of tracking argue that tracking can increase the efficiency of schooling by focusing on the needs of distinct groups of students. Opponents' main concerns relate to perpetuating and aggravating inequality. Evaluating effects of tracking on average student achievement and the distribution of achievement is difficult, in part because of variations from study to study and from country to country in the characteristics of the tracking system. Early work, largely in the United States and Britain, used variation across and within schools, and often found that tracking increased inequality in achievement. But more recent work in the United States has questioned these findings, suggesting that careful attention to endogenous placement of students into classrooms and endogenous use of tracking across schools changes results dramatically. Experimental studies on within-school tracking in the United States have produced mixed results, and one experiment in Kenya suggests that tracking can boost the achievement of both low-achieving and high-achieving students. A large body of work now uses geographical variation across regions, countries, grades, and time to identify the effects of tracking. These studies for the most part suggest that tracking aggravates inequality in outcomes. These results are fairly strong, and may be identifying the more dramatic effects that obtain when students are separated into vocational schools and more academically oriented schools, as opposed to the effects of within-school tracking. The paper concludes with an outline of how future research might better categorize and rigorously evaluate the real-world nuances of tracking.",I
"Figlio, David|Loeb, Susanna","School Accountability","School accountability--the process of evaluating school performance on the basis of student performance measures--is increasingly prevalent around the world. In the United States, accountability has become a centerpiece of both Democratic and Republican federal administrations' education policies. This chapter reviews the theory of school-based accountability, describes variations across programs, and identifies key features influencing the effectiveness and possible unintended consequences of accountability policies. The chapter then summarizes the research literature on the effects of test-based accountability on students and teachers, concluding that the preponderance of evidence suggests positive effects of the accountability movement in the United States during the 1990s and early 2000s on student achievement, especially in math. The effects on teachers and on students' long-run outcomes are more difficult to judge. It is also clear that school personnel respond to accountability in both positive and negative ways, and that accountability systems run the risk of being counter-productive if not carefully thought out and monitored.",I
"Heckman, James J.|Humphries, John Eric|Mader, Nicholas S.","The GED","The General Educational Development (GED) credential is issued on the basis of an eight-hour subject-based test. The test claims to establish equivalence between dropouts and traditional high school graduates, opening the door to college and positions in the labor market. In 2008 alone, almost 500,000 dropouts passed the test, amounting to 12% of all high school credentials issued in that year. This chapter reviews the academic literature on the GED, which finds minimal value of the certificate in terms of labor market outcomes and that only a few individuals successfully use it as a path to obtain post-secondary credentials. Although the GED establishes cognitive equivalence on one measure of scholastic aptitude, recipients still face limited opportunity due to deficits in noncognitive skills such as persistence, motivation, and reliability. The literature finds that the GED testing program distorts social statistics on high school completion rates, minority graduation gaps, and sources of wage growth. Recent work demonstrates that, through its availability and low cost, the GED also induces some students to drop out of school. The GED program is unique to the United States and Canada, but provides policy insight relevant to any nation's educational context.",I
"Black, Sandra E.|Machin, Stephen","Housing Valuations of School Performance","In this Chapter, we critically review the sizable literature that values school quality and performance through housing valuations. While highly variable in terms of research quality, the literature consistently finds housing valuations to be significantly higher in places where measured school quality is higher. Thus parents are prepared to pay substantial amounts of money to get their children educated in better performing schools. This conclusion emerges from studies across many countries, using a variety of identification strategies, and at different levels of the education system.",I
"Wolter, Stefan C.|Ryan, Paul","Apprenticeship","Apprenticeship varies greatly across countries, in terms of both quantity (numbers trained) and quality (skill content); and across sectors and occupations within countries, in terms of its provision and finance by employers. This chapter outlines recent advances in both areas. Some firms engage in apprenticeship training, others do not; some of those that do, invest in their apprentices, whereas others make a surplus on them. Despite the advances of the last two decades, there is as yet no general theory to explain the full range of financial attributes seen in practice within, let alone between, countries. Indeed recent theoretical efforts have focused excessively on specific circumstances in occupational labor markets, and neglected the potential sensitivity of their conclusions to changes in assumptions about labor markets, for both skilled workers and trainees. We also consider evaluations of the benefits of apprenticeship for individuals. Finally, the chapter considers the coordination mechanisms, principally employer bodies (associations, chambers) and employee representation and social partnership (trade unions, works councils, and joint regulatory bodies). Economic analysis indicates various ways in which such institutions may affect economic efficiency. Diversity of institutions across the countries with successful apprenticeship systems suggests, however, that there is no unique recipe for success.",I
"Campbell, Donald E.|Kelly, Jerry S.","Handbook of Social Choice and Welfare","Given a set of outcomes that affect the welfare of the members of a group, K.J. Arrow imposed the following five conditions on the ordering of the outcomes as a function of the preferences of the individual group members, and then proved that the conditions are logically inconsistent:- The social choice rule is defined for a large family of assignments of transitive orderings to individuals.- The social ordering itself is always transitive.- The social choice rule is not dictatorial. (An individual is a dictator if the social ordering ranks an outcome x strictly above another outcome y whenever that individual strictly prefers x to y.)- If everyone in the group strictly prefers outcome x to outcome y, then x should rank strictly above y in the social ordering.- The social ordering of any two outcomes depends only on the way that the individuals in the group order those same two outcomes.The chapter proves Arrow's theorem and investigates the possibility of uncovering a satisfactory social choice rule by relaxing the conditions while remaining within the Arrovian framework, which is identified by the following five characteristics:- The outcome set is unstructured.- The society is finite and fixed.- Only information about the ordering of the outcome set is used to convey information about individual welfare.- The output of the social choice process is an ordering of the outcome set.- Strategic play by individuals is not considered.",I
"Aleskerov, Fuad","Handbook of Social Choice and Welfare","Within the framework of the axiomatic approach three types of voting schemes are investigated according to the form in which the individual opinions about the alternatives are defined, as well as to the form of desired social decision. These types of rules are Social Decision Rules, Functional Voting Rules, and Social Choice Correspondences.Consideration is given to local rules, i.e., to the rules which satisfy some analogue of Arrow's Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives condition.A general description of the problem of axiomatic synthesis of local rules, and various formalizations of voting schemes are given.The notion of rationality of individual opinions and social decision is described. Various types of binary relations (preferences) are introduced. The characteristic conditions (Expansion-Contraction Axioms) on choice functions are defined, and the interrelations between them are established.Two types of Social Decision Rules (transforming individual preferences to social ones) are studied. The explicit forms of those rules are investigated. The rules restricted by rationality constraints, i.e., by the constraints on domains and ranges of the rules, are studied as well.Functional Voting Rules are investigated which transform individual opinions defined as choice functions into a social choice function. In doing so, a rationalizability of those choice functions is not assumed. The explicit form of these rules is obtained, and the rules which satisfy different rationality constraints are studied.Social Choice Correspondences deal with the case when the individual opinions are formalized as binary relations, and the collective decision that we look for is a choice function. The explicit form of rules is studied. The obtained classes comprise the rules such as the generalized Pareto rules. Several new classes of the rules are introduced and analyzed. The explicit form of the Nash-implementable rules is found.The analysis of publications on the axiomatic synthesis of the local aggregation rules is made.",I
"Gaertner, Wulf","Handbook of Social Choice and Welfare","This chapter discusses different types of domain restrictions. We begin by analyzing various qualitative conditions on preference profiles. Value-restricted preferences (with single-peaked preferences as one of its subcases), limited agreement as well as antagonistic and dichotomous preferences are relatively easy to interpret. In our view, the property of single-peakedness stands out in particular. It proves to be a central restriction under majority voting. However, it also plays an essential role in the context of strategy-proof voting rules (which is the topic of another chapter in this Handbook). Furthermore, we consider quantitative or number-specific requirements on the distribution of voters over different preference orderings, and we shall see that some of those requirements are logically related to the qualitative conditions such as extremal restriction and value-restricted preferences. While the latter restrictions are requirements on combinations of individual orderings, the domains of individual orderings that admit n-person nondictatorial social welfare functions a la Arrow result from restrictions on permissible preferences for individuals. While the first five sections study the aggregation problem within the framework of arbitrary finite sets of discrete alternatives, the final section discusses continuous choice rules; the alternatives are assumed to be n-dimensional vectors in Euclidean space. Contractibility as a condition on the topological space of preferences proves to be necessary and sufficient for the existence of continuous aggregation rules.",I
"Brams, Steven J.|Fishburn, Peter C.","Handbook of Social Choice and Welfare","Voting procedures focus on the aggregation of individuals' preferences to produce collective decisions. In practice, a voting procedure is characterized by ballot responses and the way ballots are tallied to determine winners. Voters are assumed to have clear preferences over candidates and attempt to maximize satisfaction with the election outcome by their ballot responses. Such responses can include strategic misrepresentation of preferences.Voting procedures are formalized by social choice functions, which map ballot response profiles into election outcomes. We discuss broad classes of social choice functions as well as special cases such as plurality rule, approval voting, and Borda's point-count method. The simplest class is voting procedures for two-candidate elections. Conditions for social choice functions are presented for simple majority rule, the class of weighted majority rules, and for what are referred to as hierarchical representative systems.The second main class, which predominates in the literature, embraces all procedures for electing one candidate from three or more contenders. The multicandidate elect-one social choice functions in this broad class are divided into nonranked one-stage procedures, nonranked multistage procedures, ranked voting methods, and positional scoring rules. Nonranked methods include plurality check-one voting and approval voting, where each voter casts either no vote or a full vote for each candidate. On ballots for positional scoring methods, voters rank candidates from most preferred to least preferred. Topics for multicandidate methods include axiomatic characterizations, susceptibility to strategic manipulation, and voting paradoxes that expose questionable aspects of particular procedures.Other social choice functions are designed to elect two or more candidates for committee memberships from a slate of contenders. Proportional representation methods, including systems that elect members sequentially from a single ranked ballot with vote transfers in successive counting stages, are primary examples of this class.",I
"Maskin, Eric|Sjostrom, Tomas","Handbook of Social Choice and Welfare","The implementation problem is the problem of designing a mechanism (game form) such that the equilibrium outcomes satisfy a criterion of social optimality embodied in a social choice rule. If a mechanism has the property that, in each possible state of the world, the set of equilibrium outcomes equals the set of optimal outcomes identified by the social choice rule, then the social choice rule is said to be implemented by this mechanism. Whether or not a social choice rule is implementable may depend on which game-theoretic solution concept is used. The most demanding requirement is that each agent should always have a dominant strategy, but mainly negative results are obtained in this case. More positive results are obtained using less demanding solution concepts such as Nash equilibrium. Any Nash-implementable social choice rule must satisfy a condition of monotonicity. Conversely, any social choice rule which satisfies monotonicity and no veto power can be Nash-implemented. Even non-monotonic social choice rules can be implemented using Nash equilibrium refinements. The implementation problem can be made more challenging by imposing additional requirements on the mechanisms, such as robustness to renegotiation and collusion. If the agents are incompletely informed about the state of the world, then the concept of Nash equilibrium is replaced by Bayesian Nash equilibrium. Incentive compatibility is a necessary condition for Bayesian Nash implementation, but in other respects the results closely mimic those that obtain with complete information.",I
"Moulin, Herve","Handbook of Social Choice and Welfare","The equitable division of a joint cost (or a jointly produced output) among agents with different shares or types of output (or input) commodities, is a central theme of the theory of cooperative games with transferable utility. Ever since Shapley's seminal contribution in 1953, this question has generated some of the deepest axiomatic results of modern microeconomic theory.More recently, the simpler problem of rationing a single commodity according to a profile of claims (reflecting individual needs, or demands, or liabilities) has been another fertile ground for axiomatic analysis. This rationing model is often called the bankruptcy problem in the literature.This chapter reviews the normative literature on these two models, and emphasizes their deep structural link via the Additivity axiom for cost sharing: individual cost shares depend additively upon the cost function. Loosely speaking, an additive cost-sharing method can be written as the integral of a rationing method, and this representation defines a linear isomorphism between additive cost-sharing methods and rationing methods.The simple proportionality rule in rationing thus corresponds to average cost pricing and to the Aumann-Shapley pricing method (respectively for homogeneous or heterogeneous output commodities). The uniform rationing rule, equalizing individual shares subject to the claim being an upper bound, corresponds to serial cost sharing. And random priority rationing corresponds to the Shapley-Shubik method, applying the Shapley formula to the Stand Alone costs.Several open problems are included. The axiomatic discussion of non-additive methods to share joint costs appears to be a promising direction for future research.",I
"Pattanaik, Prasanta K.","Handbook of Social Choice and Welfare","In this chapter, we seek to review some of the central concepts and results in the literature on positionalist voting rules, which goes back to Borda (1781). After the introduction of the basic notation and definitions in earlier parts of the chapter, we explore in Section 3 the distinction between positionalist and non-positionalist social ranking rules and social decision rules. We define alternative notions of positionality and give several examples. Section 4 discusses the positionalist decision procedures in the context of the conditions figuring in Arrow's celebrated impossibility theorem and also in the context of the simple majority rule. In Section 5, we review the literature on the structure of the Borda ranking rule and the Borda decision rule. Some well-known axiomatic characterizations of the Borda ranking rule and the Borda decision rule are discussed here. In Section 6, we discuss some results on the structure of score-based ranking rules and score-based decision rules, which include, as special cases, the Borda ranking rule and the Borda decision rule, respectively. This section also contains a discussion of dominance-based scoring rules and social decision rules known as runoff systems. Section 7 concludes the chapter.",I
"Peleg, Bezalel","Handbook of Social Choice and Welfare","In this chapter we adopt the axiomatic approach in order to find (new) voting procedures to committees that are immune against deviations by coalitions of voters. We shall now describe our approach. Let G be a committee and let A be a finite set of m alternatives, m [greater-or-equal, slanted] 2. Our problem is to find a social choice function F that will enable the members of G to choose one alternative out of A. We insist that F will have the following properties.(i) F should be Paretian, monotonic, and preserve the symmetries of G;(ii) the power structure induced by F should coincide with G;(iii) for each profile RN of (true) preferences of N (i.e., the set of members of G), F(RN) should be the outcome of a strong Nash equilibrium (in the strategic game specified by F and RN).Let, again, G be a committee and let A be a set of m alternatives, m [greater-or-equal, slanted] 2. The pair (G, A) is called a choice problem. A social choice function that satisfies the foregoing three criteria (i)-(iii), is called a strong representation of (G, A). If G is weak, that is, G has a vetoer, then (G, A) has a strong representation for every value of m. If G does not contain a vetoer, then there exists a natural number [mu](G) [greater-or-equal, slanted] 2 (the capacity of G), such that (G, A) has a strong representation if and only if 2 [less-than-or-equals, slant] m [less-than-or-equals, slant] [mu](G). A family of algorithms, called feasible elimination procedures, produces a strong representation to any choice problem (G, A) whenever such a representation exists. Feasible eliminations procedures produce all the strong representations of symmetric committees.",I
"Schofield, Norman","Handbook of Social Choice and Welfare","Social Choice traditionally employs the preferences of voters or agents as primitives. However, in most situations of constitutional decision-making the beliefs of the members of the electorate determine their secondary preferences or choices. Key choices in US political history, such as the ratification of the Constitution in 1787 and the election of Lincoln in 1860, were conditioned by changing beliefs as regards the truth of propositions about the political universe. Preference-based models of election tend to conclude that candidates, or parties, converge to a vote-maximizing policy position at the electoral center. Empirical work suggests that such a conclusion is invalid. This chapter argues, on the contrary, that parties or candidates adopt positions that optimize, in a Nash equilibrium sense, with respect to both their beliefs over electoral response, and their beliefs over appropriate policy choices. The analysis indicates that political choices will be different depending on whether plurality (first past the post) or proportionality is used as the method of electoral representation.",I
"d'Aspremont, Claude|Gevers, Louis","Handbook of Social Choice and Welfare","This chapter reviews the SWFL approach to social choice. It does not attempt to be a complete and systematic survey of existing results, but to give a critical assesment of the main axioms and their role in filtering the ethically relevant information, in particular the measurability and comparability properties of individual evaluation functions. Social welfare functionals are defined formally together with closely related concepts. After adducing a good number of examples, we elaborate on the meaning of the SWFL domain of definition and we sketch some alternative approaches. Several types of axioms are considered; some of them are used to filter the relevant information while others express collective efficiency or equity requirements. Then, to illustrate the various tradeoffs among these axioms, selected characterisation results are presented; most of them are cast in what we call the formally welfarist framework. Finally, we have assembled some other characterisations which eschew either invariance properties or the formally welfarist framework. We discuss the treatment of two sets of social alternatives endowed with an enriched structure, viz. the set of classical exchange economies and the complete set of lotteries one can define on an abstract set of pure alternatives. As an introduction to the latter discussion, we elaborate on the difficulties raised by social evaluation when risks and uncertainty are taken explicitly into account.",I
"Blackorby, Charles|Bossert, Walter|Donaldson, David","Handbook of Social Choice and Welfare","This chapter provides a survey of utilitarian theories of justice. We review and discuss axiomatizations of utilitarian and generalized-utilitarian social-evaluation functionals in a welfarist framework. Section 2 introduces, along with some basic definitions, social-evaluation functionals. Furthermore, we discuss several information-invariance assumptions. In Section 3, we introduce the welfarism axioms unrestricted domain, binary independence of irrelevant alternatives and Pareto indifference, and use them to characterize welfarist social evaluation. These axioms imply that there exists a single ordering of utility vectors that can be used to rank all alternatives for any profile of individual utility functions. We call such an ordering a social-evaluation ordering, and we introduce several examples of classes of such orderings. In addition, we formulate some further basic axioms. Section 4 provides characterizations of generalized-utilitarian social-evaluation orderings, both in a static and in an intertemporal framework. Section 5 deals with the special case of utilitarianism. We review some known axiomatizations and, in addition, prove a new characterization result that uses an axiom we call incremental equity. In Section 6, we analyze generalizations of utilitarian principles to variable-population environments. We extend the welfarism theorem to a variable-population framework and provide a characterization of critical-level generalized utilitarianism. Section 7 provides an extension to situations in which the alternatives resulting from choices among feasible actions are not known with certainty. In this setting, we discuss characterization as well as impossibility results. Section 8 concludes.",I

"Kaushik, Basu|Lòpez-Calva, Luis F.","Handbook of Social Choice and Welfare","Traditional economics identifies a person's well-being with the goods and services the person consumes and the utility that the person gets from such consumption. This, in turn, has led to the widely used approach of welfarism that uses individual utilities as ingredients for evaluating a society's aggregate welfare. This approach has long been contested as being too restrictive in its view of what constitutes human well-being and for its commodity fetish. What has injected new life into this critique is the emergence of an alternative approach, which replaces the traditional concern for commodities and utility with functionings and capabilities. While the origins of this capabilities approach go back to the works of John Stuart Mill, Adam Smith, and, in spirit if not in form, to Aristotle, it was the seminal contribution of Amartya Sen in the form of his 1979 Tanner Lectures that gave it shape and structure. Subsequent works by Sen and an enormous outpouring of writing by various authors in economics, philosophy, and sociology have made this a major field of inquiry, which has also led to important practical applications. The present chapter is a survey of this new field of study. In Sen's terminology a functioning is what an individual chooses to do or to be, in contrast to a commodity, which is an instrument which enables her to achieve different functionings. While functioning is central to the notion of human well-being, it is not merely the achieved functionings that matter but the freedom that a person has in choosing from the set of feasible functionings, which is referred to as the person's capability. Beginning with a discussion of these ideas in history, the present chapter tries to present a comprehensive review of the recent literature, including formalizations and applications. It is important to recognize that a full formalization may not be feasible, since there are important dimensions of life that are germane to the capabilities approach that may be impossible to capture in a single formalization. Nevertheless, the capability approach itself has been immensely useful in the context of studying poverty, gender issues, political freedom, and the standard of living. It has also resulted in the creation of the Human Development Index (HDI), popularized by UNDP's Human Development Reports since 1990. This chapter critically examines the HDI and recent advances in the human development literature.",I

"Marc, Fleurbaey|François, Maniquet","Handbook of Social Choice and Welfare","Many distributive issues involve situations in which initial characteristics make individuals unequal. In view of prevailing moral sentiments, some of these characteristics call for compensating transfers, and some do not. We study the literature on this problem of compensation. This literature follows the distinction between the ethical principle of compensation and that of responsibility. According to the former, a good resource allocation system should neutralize the differential influence over agents outcomes of the characteristics that elicit compensation. According to the latter, a good resource allocation system should remain neutral with respect to inequality arising from the influence of characteristics that do not elicit compensation. The principle of responsibility can be interpreted as a libertarian principle of natural reward, or as a principle of utilitarian reward. Depending on whether the emphasis is put on the principle of compensation or of responsibility, and depending on how the latter is interpreted, there exist four main families of solutions to compensation problems. We review the axiomatic analyses of these four families of solutions in the different models in which they have been studied. We also review the applications that have been made of these solutions to problems of income taxation, education investment, social mobility and health insurance systems.",I

This chapter focuses on this logical conflict and tries to find a way of balancing these two important values in human well-being. We will identify three issues in this line of research, viz., the formal articulation of rights, the social realization of rights, and the initial conferment of rights. We will also examine the sustainability of Sen's concept of individual rights and examine the game form articulation of individual rights as a viable alternative to Sen's proposed concept.",I

"Saari, Donald G.","Handbook of Social Choice and Welfare","It is shown how simple geometry can be used to analyze and discover new properties about pairwise and positional voting rules as well as for those rules (e.g., runoffs and Approval Voting) that rely on these methods. The description starts by providing a geometric way to depict profiles, which simplifies the computation of the election outcomes. This geometry is then used to motivate the development of a profile coordinate system, which evolves into a tool to analyze voting rules. This tool, for instance, completely explains various longstanding paradoxes, such as why a Condorcet winner need not be elected with certain voting rules. A different geometry is developed to indicate whether certain voting oddities can be dismissed or must be taken seriously, and to explain why other mysteries, such as strategic voting and the no-show paradox (where a voter is rewarded by not voting), arise. Still another use of geometry extends McGarvey's Theorem about possible pairwise election rankings to identify the actual tallies that can arise (a result that is needed to analyze supermajority voting). Geometry is also developed to identify all possible positional and Approval Voting election outcomes that are admitted by a given profile; the converse becomes a geometric tool that can be used to discover new election relationships. Finally, it is shown how lessons learned in social choice, such as the seminal Arrow's and Sen's Theorems and the expanding literature about the properties of positional rules, provide insights into difficulties that are experienced by other disciplines.",I
"B. D.

A variety of open access models have developed over the last twenty years, including author self-archiving, immediate (sponsored) open access, delayed open access, and article-processing-fee open access. Yet the economics of open access is being largely determined, at this point, by the interests of a stratified scholarly publishing market that can be roughly divided among independent journals, scholarly society publishers, and commercial publishers. Each of these market segments is experimenting with forms of open access that hold promise for sustaining, if not extending, the segments current position. This paper reviews the economics of these open access models, while drawing attention to the consequences of this market stratification for access to knowledge and the sustainability of scholarly publishing as a whole.",I

Understanding the spread of economic stimulus and subsequent indirect business and consumption effects is important because of the changing patterns of business operations, employment and supply chains in the resources sector. The focus of the research reported in this paper was to identify the geographical spread of economic impacts from the resources sector across Queensland. The results of the analysis demonstrate that incomes and expenditures from the resources sectors are widely distributed across the state, and generate significant flow-on effects. It is notable that the industry makes a strong direct contribution in many of the more remote areas of Queensland, helping to underpin economic conditions in those regions. Expenditure from the resources industry has indirect impacts on the business environment in many areas, and generates substantial levels of production in south-east Queensland and central Queensland in particular.",R

This article uses historical data, together with modern time series methods, to examine empirically the factors that might have contributed to growth in passenger rail demand in Melbourne, Australia, and to gain greater insight into the relationships between the various explanatory variables. A cointegration approach is used to estimate the long-run rail elasticities, while an error correction model is used to estimate short-run elasticities. The study finds that the short  run rail elasticity is twice as low as the long-run elasticity, although both are highly inelastic. The inelastic nature of the demand suggests that a fare increase would not lead to a significant drop in boardings, and hence results in a rise in total revenue. In addition to the fare, city population, petrol price and passenger income exert a positive impact on passenger rail demand.",F
"Gerdtham, Ulf-G.|Jonsson, Bengt","Handbook of Health Economics","Comparisons of aggregate health expenditure across different countries have become popular over the last three decades as they permit a systematic investigation of the impact of different institutional regimes and other explanatory variables. Over the years, several regression analyses based on cross-section and panel data have been used to explain the international differences in health expenditure. A common result of these studies is that aggregate income appears to be the most important factor explaining health expenditure variation between countries and that the size of the estimated income elasticity is high and even higher than unity which in that case indicates that health care is a luxury good. Additional results indicates, for example, that the use of primary care gatekeepers lowers health expenditure and also that the way of remunerating physicians in the ambulatory care sector appears to influence health expenditure; capitation systems tend to lead to lower expenditure than fee-for-service systems. Finally, we also list some issues for the future. We demand more efforts on theory of the macroeconomic analysis of health expenditure, which is underdeveloped at least relative to the macroeconometrics of health expenditure. We also demand more replications based on updated data and methods that seeks to unify the many differing results of previous Studies.",I
"Hurley, Jeremiah","Handbook of Health Economics","This chapter provides an overview of normative analysis in the health sector in recent decades. It surveys two distinct, but related, literatures. The first is normative analysis of the operation of health care and health care insurance markets, market failure, and the scope for non-market institutional arrangements to improve the efficiency and equity of the financing, funding, organization and delivery of health care. The second is the debate about the most appropriate normative framework within which to carry out normative analysis in the health sector, focusing on the welfarist and extra-welfarist frameworks. This is a debate about assumptions and methods. Although the rival frameworks share the broad conclusion that market failure pervades the health sector, the diagnoses regarding nature of that failure sometimes differ and, more importantly, the prescriptions to improve efficiency and equity often differ. Because it is not always clear what writers mean by welfare economics and extra-welfarism, I briefly summarize key concepts of efficiency and key assumptions and elements of each framework. The three subsequent sections then analyze the nature of health care as an economic commodity and the implications of these characteristics both for the operation of health care and health care insurance markets and for the methods of normative economic analysis. Section 4 surveys prominent approaches to analyzing equity in health care. Section 5 examines the methods of normative analysis as applied to evaluate individual health care services. Finally, I end with some observations on recent discussions of the role of normative economic analysis in policy making and of health economists as policy advisors.",I
"Berndt, Ernst R.|Cutler, David M.|Frank, Richard G.|Griliches, Zvi|Newhouse, Joseph P.|Triplett, Jack E.","Handbook of Health Economics","We review in considerable detail the conceptual and measurement issues that underlie construction of medical care price indexes in the US, focusing in particular on the medical care consumer price indexes (MCPIs) and medical-related producer price indexes (MPPIs). We outline salient features of the medical care marketplace, including the impacts of insurance, moral hazard, principal-agent relationships, technological progress and organizational changes. Since observed data are unlikely to correspond with efficient outcomes, we discuss implications of the failure of transactions data in this market to reveal reliable marginal valuations, and the consequent need to augment traditional transactions data with information based on cost-effectiveness and outcomes studies.We describe procedures currently used by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics in constructing MCPIs and MPPIs, including recent revisions, and then consider alternative notions of medical care output pricing that involve the price or cost of an episode of treatment, rather than prices of fixed bundles of inputs. We outline features of a proposed new experimental price index -- a medical care expenditure price index -- that is more suitable for evaluation and analyses of medical care cost changes, than are the current MCPIs and MPPIs. We discuss the ways in which medical care transactions enter national economic accounts, including inter-industry flows and national health accounts, as well as aggregate economy implications of possible mismeasurement of prices in the medical sector. We conclude by suggesting future research and measurement issues that are most likely to be fruitful.",I
"Garber, Alan M.","Handbook of Health Economics","Recent work has clarified the welfare implications of the application of cost-effectiveness analysis to the allocation of health care. Although cost-effectiveness analysis shares many similarities with cost-benefit analysis, it did not develop as an outgrowth of neoclassical welfare economics. Consequently, even though the welfare implications of public decisionmaking based on cost-benefit analysis have long been understood, until recently the conditions under which decisions made on the basis of cost-effectiveness criteria lead to potential Pareto improvement had received little attention.This chapter describes the welfare economic foundations of cost-effectiveness analysis and how such foundations can be applied to resolve controversies in the application of the technique. It also discusses procedures for applying the technique, the circumstances under which decision rules based on cost-effectiveness analysis have desirable welfare economic properties, the appropriate perspective for the analysis, and issues in measuring outcomes. Even when standard welfare economic assumptions are not fully accurate descriptions of the markets and conditions in which health care is delivered, cost-effectiveness analysis can be a useful guide to allocation decisions.",I
"Phelps, Charles E.","Handbook of Health Economics","Incomplete information issues pervade health care markets, with market participants often having relatively little information, and their behavior exhibiting corresponding aberrations from classic market behavior.Consumers often have relatively little information about prices and quality offered in health care markets, leading to substantial dispersion in prices of apparently identical services. Equilibrium price dispersion increases as the demand elasticity for the product falls. Since health insurance lowers the elasticity of demand, price dispersions should occur more often (and with greater magnitude) in markets such as physician services with relatively complete insurance. Further, many insurance plans blunt incentives for search, compounding the problem.On the supply side, evidence shows that physicians behave as if they did not share the same information about the productivity of medical care. At the level of geographic regions, numerous studies show the rates at which various medical interventions are used on standardized populations differ hugely -- often by an order of magnitude or more from high to low -- and these differences in treatment rates do not converge through time as would occur in standard market learning models.Similarly, individual physicians within a given region also display differences in the propensity to use medical resources. Information from a major study of doctors' styles shows large and statistically significant differences in doctors' use of medical resources to treat their patients, even with strong measures of illness severity of the patients included in the models.Although requiring strong assumptions, one can estimate the welfare losses arising from incomplete information on the provider side of the market. Estimates of the upper bound of these welfare losses place the magnitude of loss in the same range on a per capita basis as the traditionally emphasized welfare losses associated with perverse incentives in health insurance.The importance of incomplete information leads to discussions of the economic and legal incentives for the production and dissemination of information. Legal incentives to produce such information for medical strategies (treatment protocols) are weak, particularly compared with the incentives in markets for specific products such as prescription drugs. The public good nature of such information and the government role in supporting its production and dissemination form the concluding parts of this chapter.",I
"Jones, Andrew M.","Handbook of Health Economics","A decade ago, Newhouse (1987) assessed the balance of trade between imports from the econometrics literature into health economics, and exports from health economics to a wider audience. While it is undoubtedly true that imports of concepts and techniques still dominate the balance, the literature reviewed in this chapter shows that the range and volume of applied econometric work in health economics has increased dramatically over the past ten years.Examples of good practice in health econometrics make extensive use of tests for misspecification and explicit model selection criteria. Robust and distribution-free estimators are of increasing importance, and the chapter gives examples of nonparametric, and semiparametric estimators applied to sample selection, simultaneous equations, count data, and survival models.Published replications of empirical results remain relatively rare. One way in which this deficit may be remedied is through the appearance of more systematic reviews of econometric studies. The use of experimental data remains an exception and most applied studies continue to rely on observational data from secondary sources. However applied work in health economics is likely to be influenced by the debate concerning the use of data from social experiments.The chapter illustrates the impressive diversity of applied econometric work over the past decade. Most of the studies reviewed here use individual level data and this has led to the use of a wide range of nonlinear models, including qualitative and limited dependent variables, along with count, survival and frontier models. Because of the widespread use of observational data, particular attention has gone into dealing with problems of self-selection and heterogeneity bias. This is likely to continue in the future, with the emphasis on robust estimators applied to longitudinal and other complex datasets.",I
"Grossman, Michael","Handbook of Health Economics","This chapter contains a detailed treatment of the human capital model of the demand for health which was originally developed in 1972. Theoretical predictions are discussed, and theoretical extensions of the model are reviewed. Empirical research that tests the predictions of the model or studies causality between years of formal schooling completed and good health is surveyed. The model views health as a durable capital stock that yields an output of healthy time. Individuals inherit an initial amount of this stock that depreciates with age and can be increased by investment. The household production function model of consumer behavior is employed to account for the gap between health as an output and medical care as one of many inputs into its production. In this framework the shadow price of health depends on many variables besides the price of medical care. It is shown that the shadow price rises with age if the rate of depreciation on the stock of health rises over the life cycle and falls with education (years of formal schooling completed) if more educated people are more efficient producers of health. An important result is that, under certain conditions, an increase in the shadow price may simultaneously reduce the quantity of health demanded and increase the quantities of health inputs demanded.",I
"Zweifel, Peter|Manning, Willard G.","Handbook of Health Economics","Consumer incentives are reflected in a wide range of choices, many of which occur in both insurance- and tax-financed health care systems. However, health insurance and sick leave pay cause consumer incentives to be reflected in moral hazard effects of several types. Theoretically, ex ante moral hazard (a reduction of preventive effort in response to insurance coverage) is not unambiguously predicted, and there is very limited empirical evidence about it. The case for static ex post moral hazard (an increase in the demand for medical care of a given technology) is stronger. The empirical evidence reported comes from three sources, natural experiments, observational comparisons of individuals, and the Health Insurance Experiment (HIE). The distinguishing feature of the HIE is that participants were assigned to insurance plans, which forestalls the possibility of good risks self-selecting plans with substantial cost sharing, resulting in an overestimate of the effects of plan design on health care expenditure. While the values of estimated price elasticities vary widely among the three sources and less markedly according to the type of care (outpatient, hospital, dental, mental), the responsiveness of the demand for medical care to net price is beyond doubt. The pure price elasticity for medical care in excess of a deductible (i.e. where the marginal price is constant) was estimated by HIE at -0.2 overall. Finally, there may be a dynamic moral hazard effect (choice biased in favor of new, usually more expensive medical technology). Here, the empirical evidence is very scanty again. Another promising field for future research is the interplay between consumer incentives and rationing by the physician in managed care.",I
"McGuire, Thomas G.","Handbook of Health Economics","This chapter reviews the theory and empirical literature on physician market power, behavior, and motives, referred to collectively as the issue of physician agency. The chapter is organized around an increasingly complex view of the demand conditions facing a physician, beginning with the most simple conception associated with demand and supply, and building through monopolistic competition models with complete information, and finally models with asymmetric information. Institutional features such as insurance, price regulation, managed care networks and noncontractible elements of quality of care are incorporated in turn. The review reveals three mechanisms physicians may use to influence quantity of care provided to patients: quantity setting of a nonretradable service, influencing demand by setting the level of a noncontractible input (quality), and, in an asymmetric-information context, taking an action to influence patient preferences. The third mechanism is known as physician-induced demand. The empirical literature on this topic is reviewed. Theories based on alternatives to profit-maximization as objectives of physicians are also reviewed, including ethics and concern for patients, and the target-income hypothesis. The target-income hypothesis can be rejected, although there is empirical support for non-profit maximizing behavior.",I
"Pauly, Mark V.","Handbook of Health Economics","This paper discusses theoretical and empirical findings concerning insurance reimbursement of patients or providers by insurers operating in private markets or in mixed public and private systems. Most insurances other than health insurance do not reimburse; instead they pay cash to insureds conditional on the occurrence of a prespecified event. In contrast, health insurance ties the payment to medical expenditures or costs incurred in some fashion, often making payments directly to medical providers. These differences are caused by a much higher degree of moral hazard and the dominant effect of insurer demand on provider prices. Health insurances also often prohibit balance billing, provider charges in excess of some prespecified amount. Such prohibitions are related to patient inability to shop or bargain, and to insurer market power.Empirical evidence suggests that some versions of physician and hospital reimbursement have increased the level of medical spending relative to the level that would be experienced under prospective payment. In particular, cost-based reimbursement raises total spending. Optimal reimbursement, with balance billing prohibited, may also be chosen to control moral hazard; payment will generally involve a mix of fee-for-service and predetermined (salary or capitation) payment, and may well involve positive patient cost sharing. Monopsony behavior by dominant insurers is possible, and may improve consumer welfare but not total welfare.",I
"Cutler, David M.|Zeckhauser, Richard J.","Handbook of Health Economics","This article describes the anatomy of health insurance. It begins by considering the optimal design of health insurance policies. Such policies must make tradeoffs appropriately between risk sharing on the one hand and agency problems such as moral hazard (the incentive of people to seek more care when they are insured) and supplier-induced demand (the incentive of physicians to provide more care when they are well reimbursed) on the other. Optimal coinsurance arrangements make patients pay for care up to the point where the marginal gains from less risk sharing are just offset by the marginal benefits from reduced provision of low valued care. Empirical evidence shows that both moral hazard and demand-inducement are quantitatively important. Coinsurance based on expenditure is a crude control mechanism. Moreover, it places no direct incentives on physicians, who are responsible for most expenditure decisions. To place such incentives on physicians is the goal of supply-side cost containment measures, such as utilization review and capitation. This goal motivates the surge in managed care in the United States, which unites the functions of insurance and provision, and allows for active management of the care that is delivered.The analysis then turns to the operation of health insurance markets. Economists generally favor choice in health insurance for the same reasons they favor choice in other markets: choice allows people to opt for the plan that is best for them and encourages plans to provide services efficiently. But choice in health insurance is a mixed blessing because of adverse selection -- the tendency of the sick to choose more generous insurance than the healthy. When sick and healthy enroll in different plans, plans disproportionately composed of poor risks have to charge more than they would if they insured an average mix of people. The resulting high premiums create two adverse effects: they discourage those who are healthier but would prefer generous care from enrolling in those plans (because the premiums are so high), and they encourage plans to adopt measures that deter the sick from enrolling (to reduce their overall costs). The welfare losses from adverse selection are large in practice. Added to them are further losses from premiums that vary with observable health status. Because insurance is contracted for annually, people are denied a valuable form of intertemporal insurance -- the right to buy health coverage at average rates in the future should they get sick today. As the ability to predict future health status increases, the lack of intertemporal insurance will become more problematic.The article concludes by relating health insurance to the central goal of medical care expenditures -- better health. Studies to date are not clear on which approaches to health insurance promote health in the most cost-efficient manner. Resolving this question is the central policy concern in health economics.",I
"Gruber, Jonathan","Handbook of Health Economics","A distinctive feature of the health insurance market in the US is the restriction of group insurance availability to the workplace. This has a number of important implications for the functioning of the labor market, through mobility from job-to-job or in and out of the labor force, wage determination, and hiring decisions. This paper reviews the large literature that has emerged in recent years to assess the impact of health insurance on the labor market. I begin with an overview of the institutional details relevant to assessing the interaction of health insurance and the labor market. I then present a theoretical overview of the effects of health insurance on mobility and wage/employment determination. I critically review the empirical literature on these topics, focusing in particular on the methodological issues that have been raised, and highlighting the unanswered questions which can be the focus of future work in this area.",I
"Glied, Sherry","Handbook of Health Economics","By 1993, over 70% of all Americans with health insurance were enrolled in some form of managed care plan. The term managed care encompasses a diverse array of institutional arrangements, which combine various sets of mechanisms, that, in turn, have changed over time. The chapter reviews these mechanisms, which, in addition to the methods employed by traditional insurance plans, include the selection and organization of providers, the choice of payment methods (including capitation and salary payment), and the monitoring of service utilization.Managed care has a long history. For an extended period, this form of organization was discouraged by a hostile regulatory environment. Since the early 1980s, however, managed care has grown dramatically. Neither theoretical nor empirical research has yet provided an explanation for this pattern of growth. The growth of managed care may be due to this organizational form's relative success in responding to underlying market failures in the health care system -- asymmetric information about health risks, moral hazard, limited information on quality, and limited industry competitiveness. The chapter next explores managed care's response to each of these problems.The chapter then turns to empirical research on managed care. Managed care plans appear to attract a population that is somewhat lower cost than that enrolled in conventional insurance. This complicates analysis of the effect of managed care on utilization. Nonetheless, many studies suggest that managed care plans reduce the rate of health care utilization somewhat. Less evidence exists on their effect on overall health care costs and cost growth.",I
"Van de ven, Wynand P.M.M.|Ellis, Randall P.","Handbook of Health Economics","In the 1990s many countries have chosen to use prospective payment arrangements for health plans (e.g., health insurers, sickness funds or HMOs) together with health plan competition, as a means of creating incentives to be cost conscious, while preserving quality, innovation and responsiveness to consumer preferences. Risk adjustment is an important mechanism for attenuating problems that threaten the effectiveness of this strategy for resource allocation in health care. Without adequate risk adjustment, competing health plans have incentives to avoid individuals with predictable losses and to select predictably profitable members. This selection and the resulting risk segmentation can have adverse effects in terms of access to care, quality of care and efficiency in the production of care.This chapter first provides a conceptual framework for thinking about risk adjustment. Second, it gives an overview of the progress developing risk adjustment models in recent years. Third, several forms of risk sharing are discussed, which can be used as a tool for reducing selection in case of imperfect risk adjustment. Fourth, an overview is given of the current practice of risk adjustment and risk sharing in 11 countries. Finally some directions for future research are discussed.",I

"Frank, Richard G.|McGuire, Thomas G.","Handbook of Health Economics","This paper is concerned with the economics of mental health. We argue that mental health economics is like health economics only more so: uncertainty and variation in treatments are greater; the assumption of patient self-interested behavior is more dubious; response to financial incentives such as insurance is exacerbated; the social consequences and external costs of illness are more formidable. We elaborate on these statements and consider their implications throughout the chapter. Special characteristics of mental illness and persons with mental illness are identified and related to observations on institutions paying for and providing mental health services. We show that adverse selection and moral hazard appear to hit mental health markets with special force. We discuss the emergence of new institutions within managed care that address longstanding problems in the sector. Finally, we trace the shifting role of government in this sector of the health economy.",I
"Norton, Edward C.","Handbook of Health Economics","This chapter summarizes recent theoretical and empirical economic research on long-term care. Long-term care differs from acute medical care in four fundamental ways. Long-term care is care for chronic illness, the nursing home industry is dominated by for-profit facilities sometimes facing excess demand, long-term care is often provided by unpaid caregivers, and little private long-term care insurance is purchased. This chapter starts with a taxonomy of long-term care, from expensive formal nursing home care to the vast provision of informal care provided in the home. The taxonomy is followed by a review of the supply of and demand for long-term care. Competition between predominantly for-profit nursing homes is an issue for industrial organization. Raising the public reimbursement rate to nursing homes paradoxically may actually lower quality. The supply of informal care, usually by daughters, is an issue for labor economics. Women who provide informal care may reduce their hours in the labor force. Private insurance for such large and uncertain health expenditures is an issue for risk and insurance. Few elderly purchase long-term care insurance, despite the high expenditure risk, for a variety of sound reasons. Savings behavior, whether for precautionary motives or bequests, is an issue for life-cycle behavior. A means-tested public insurance program combined with uncertainty about future expenditures may cause a separating equilibrium in which people either save for precautionary reasons or save nothing. Finally, a look to the future shows that demographic trends will greatly increase the number and percentage of elderly in industrialized nations. Future long-term care expenditures are not likely to be as burdensome as many fear. Although the majority of citations are from research in the United States, the issues presented here are usually pertinent to other industrialized nations.",I
"Haveman, Robert|Wolfe, Barbara","Handbook of Health Economics","We discuss and critique the main lines of economic research that address the economic status and behavior of the working-age population of people with disabilities. We define this population as those with physical or mental limitations that impede their daily activities or their productivity on the job. Using this definition, we assess the prevalence, trend, and composition of the population of disabled working-aged people in the United States and other Western societies, and document the extent of market work among this population. Such market work contributes to the economic well-being of the working-age disabled, but for most of them, income from public transfers and from the earnings of other household members are crucial in determining the level of family economic well-being. Relative to the nondisabled, those with disabilities have substantially lower levels of economic well-being in spite of public income support programs. While public income support is important in sustaining the level of well-being of the disabled, these policies also have serious incentive effects, especially labor supply disincentives. We document these incentive effects in US policy, and review the research studies that estimate the response of disabled people to these incentives. In addition to income support policy, we also describe public policy toward disabled people associated with antidiscrimination legislation, rehabilitation and training programs, income support for poor disabled children, and public regulations and financial support for special education in schools. We conclude by comparing US disability policy with that in other Western industrialized countries and identifying research issues that are relevant to all societies with advanced policies toward working-age people with disabilities.",I
"Currie, Janet","Handbook of Health Economics","This chapter provides an overview of the literature on child health in developed countries. I first lay out a simple economic model of the demand for child health inputs, and discuss whether the evidence is consistent with that model. Next, two main causes of market failure in the market for child health inputs -- lack of information and externalities -- are analyzed. These failures may provide an economic rationale for government intervention in the market for health care. Much of the literature on child health has focused on one such intervention, the provision of public health insurance. However, the utilization of health care is only one input into the production of child health, and it is far from the most important input for most children. Hence, the last section of this chapter offers a brief review of what we know about the effects of government interventions designed to address other threats to child health. The chapter concludes with some opinions about useful direction for future research and data collection efforts.",I
"Dranove, David|Satterthwaite, Mark A.","Handbook of Health Economics","Health care markets fail to satisfy many requirements for perfect competition, including large numbers of consumers and firms, zero search costs, and marketability of all goods and services. Over time, health care markets have evolved to overcome the resulting inefficiencies. We combine the theory of agency with a model of monopolistic competition to explore three regimes of health care organization that were dominant at different points in time: (1) independent physicians and cost-based reimbursement for hospitals; (2) regulation; and (3) managed care. Each regime represents, for its time, a sensible response to market failure. Each regime has predictable consequences for prices, costs, and quality. We examine the theoretical arguments and review the empirical evidence about each regime. A consistent message emerges: Providers respond to economic incentives in a manner consistent with theory.",I
"Sloan, Frank A.","Handbook of Health Economics","The for-profit hospital is in the minority numerically in all developed countries. Although the for-profits' market share has been quite stable for decades, for-profit chains have grown in share and influence in the United States. By contrast, for-profit chains have made few inroads in other countries.The literature on hospital ownership addresses three fundamental questions. First, why do private not-for-profit organizations dominate the hospital industry? Second, how do private not-for-profits differ from for-profits in their behavior? Third, is the private not-for-profit form more efficient in this industry?The main difference between for-profit and private not-for-profit organizations is in the distribution of accounting profit. The latter do not distribute profits to equity holders and enjoy some competitive advantages, including tax exemptions and the ability to receive private donations. Various reasons for why the not-for-profit form is dominant are explored. Reasons involve: transactions costs of various ownership forms; fiduciary relationships between patients and providers; public goods; implicit and explicit subsidies; inertia; cartelization; and lack of profit opportunities. The review concludes that there is merit in an number of explanations, but no single explanation works perfectly. Certainly the transactions cost of various ownership forms must provide a partial explanation for observed patterns of hospital ownership.There is a rich empirical literature on hospital behavior. This chapter discusses comparative evidence by hospital ownership form on hospital cost, profitability, pricing and cost-shifting, uncompensated care, diffusion of technology, quality of care, and hospital capital funds and investment.In recent years, changes in hospital ownership have been common in the United States. Changes have occurred in all directions -- from private not-for-profit to for-profit and the reverse, for example. Comparing hospital behavior before and after the conversion, the fact that a hospital converted seems to be more important than the type of ownership change that occurred.As competition among hospitals increases, differences in behavior among hospitals with different ownership forms should narrow. Privately owned hospitals in the U.S. were more alike than different. Private not-for-profit hospitals will have less latitude than previously to produce outputs they deem to be socially worthy.The chapter ends with the author's agenda for future research.",I
"Scott, Anthony","Handbook of Health Economics","General (or family) practice and its role within primary care is increasingly regarded as the key to achieving efficiency and equity in many health care systems. This is particularly relevant where general practitioners (GPs) act as gatekeepers to specialist care. This chapter outlines the main economic issues in general practice. Within the context of gatekeeping, the first half of the chapter examines literature on agency, patient choice and preferences for GP services, and the utilisation of GP services. Given that much demand is determined by supply, this is followed by an examination of the determinants of referral behaviour, the effects of payment systems, and GPs as firms (partnerships and vertical integration). Overall, there has been little research by economists in these areas. This needs to be rectified giving the growing importance of primary care in many health care systems.",I
"Cullis, John G.|Jones, Philip R.|Propper, Carol","Handbook of Health Economics","A number of health care systems use waiting time as a rationing device for access to inpatient care. However, a considerable amount of research has focussed in particular on the UK's National Health Service and its perceived problem of waiting lists. In this chapter a theoretical discussion addresses the issue of the optimum wait in the context of Paretian welfare economics. However, reference is also made to public choice analysis and to queuing theory. Empirical literature that explores the various dimensions of waiting costs is reviewed and evaluated. Different methods of estimation are illustrated and these include contingent valuation, implied valuation and econometric modelling. The policy section assesses various solutions to the waiting list problem. Options are classified in terms of their impact on excess demand and the issue of waiting list management is addressed. In the absence of an over-arching welfare analysis both empirical work and policy recommendations are inevitably piece-meal and open to debate. Given the inherent weaknesses of applied welfare economics the challenge is to find a framework which would attract a broader consensus.",I

"Scherer, F.M.","Handbook of Health Economics","This Handbook chapter surveys the extensive body of research on the economics of the pharmaceutical industry (with peripheral attention paid also to regulated medical devices). Pharmaceuticals is one of the world's most research-intensive industries, generating a continuing steam of new products that save lives and raise the quality of life. The discovery of new drugs has evolved over time from a decidedly empirical process to one based to a considerable degree upon fundamental scientific knowledge. Rich linkages have emerged between profit-seeking manufacturers and basic research performers such as universities and national laboratories. The safety and efficacy of new pharmaceutical products are stringently regulated in most industrialized nations, adding to clinical testing costs. Because of high expenditures on research, development, and clinical testing and because new products, once proven, might be imitated easily, patent protection is unusually important. The extension of patent protection to third-world nations under Uruguay Round Treaty mandates has precipitated vigorous policy debates. Patents, first-mover advantages, and the lack of good substitutes for significant new drugs often give rise to substantial monopoly power, against which many national governments have counterpoised a diverse panoply of price control mechanisms. When patents expire, however, generic substitutes often introduce vigorous price competition. The extent to which generics capture market share from the branded original drugs depends upon government regulatory policies, the reimbursement strategies of health care insurers, and the organization of health care provider institutions.",I
"Danzon, Patricia M.","Handbook of Health Economics","Physicians are traditionally liable under a negligence rule of liability. Economic analysis of liability rules, including malpractice, assumes that the primary function of liability is injury prevention (deterrence). Compensation can be provided more efficiently through other forms of social or private insurance. In theory, a negligence rule creates incentives for efficient care, hence there should be no negligence, no claims and no demand for liability insurance. In practice, the incidence of negligent injury has been estimated at roughly one per hundred hospital admissions in the US and about one in seven physicians is sued per year.These discrepancies between the theory and actual operation of the negligence system arise primarily because of imperfect information on the part of courts, doctors, patients, liability insurers and health insurers. Imperfect information and extensive health insurance lead to biased and uncertain legal standards. Uncertain legal standards create incentives for physicians to practice defensive medicine and incentives for plaintiffs and defendants to invest in litigation, leading to high overhead costs, such that compensation through the malpractice system carries a load of $1.50 per $1.00 of compensation.Nevertheless, the extreme criticisms of the malpractice system are exaggerated. Malpractice premiums are less than 1 percent of total health care costs. There are no comprehensive estimates of defensive medicine costs; in any case such costs are likely to decline with the growth of managed care. Although claim disposition exhibits both Type 1 and Type 2 errors, negligent injuries are much more likely to lead to a claim being field and payment to the plaintiff than non-negligent injuries, and awards are strongly related to loss incurred. The limited empirical evidence of provider response to liability and the deterrent effect of claims suggests -- but cannot prove -- that the net benefits of the malpractice system may plausibly be positive. Nevertheless, reforms designed to reduce inappropriate compensation and deter excessive litigation and defensive practice would make the system more cost-effective.The empirical evidence, based primarily in the US, includes studies of malpractice injuries; physician response to liability; trends in claim frequency, severity (size), and claim disposition; and the malpractice insurance market. Analyses of actual and proposed reforms address tort reform, no fault, enterprise liability and optimal liability under managed care. More limited evidence is available on the negligence regimes in Canada and the UK, and the quasi no-fault regimes in Sweden and New Zealand.",I
"Gaynor, Martin|Vogt, William B.","Handbook of Health Economics","In this chapter we review issues relating to antitrust and competition in health care markets. The chapter begins with a brief review of antitrust legislation. We then discuss whether and how health care is different from other industries in ways that might affect the optimality of competition. The chapter then focuses on the main areas in which antitrust has been applied to health care: hospital mergers, monopsony, and foreclosure. In each of these sections we review the relevant antitrust cases, discuss the issues that have arisen in those cases, and then review the relevant economics literature and suggest some new methods for analyzing these issues.",I
"Salkever, David S.","Handbook of Health Economics","With the spread of cost-based hospital payment systems in the United States in the 1960s, and the implementation of the Medicare and Medicaid programs in 1966, rapidly rising hospital costs imposed unexpected pressures on Federal and state budgets and generated a demand for regulatory interventions. Large numbers of states responded with regulatory controls on hospital investment and a significant minority of states enacted hospital price regulation (rate-setting) laws. As strong hospital sector inflation continued into the 1970s, Federal efforts to regulate prices (through the Economic Stabilization Program) and to encourage additional state regulation were also enacted. This chapter reviews the economic research on the impact of these regulatory interventions, focusing on econometric studies in particular. Several conclusions emerge from this review. First, studies of adoption of regulation show that pressure on state budgets and pro-regulation political views were more influential than provider capture or rent-seeking factors. Second, cost-containment impacts of state rate-setting programs varied over time, with changes in the national health care economy and major Federal policy thrusts. Third, there is little evidence that investment controls reduced the rate of cost growth though inconsistent reports of constraining effects on numbers of beds and diffusion of some specialized services did appear. Fourth, econometric studies of the Medicare Prospective Payment System (PPS) supported the presumption that PPS would constrain the growth in cost per case, but concomitant increases in case-mix intensity and declines in admissions raised questions about (1) the extent to which PPS truly induced efficiency gains and (2) the adequacy of our analytic models of hospital behavior. Fifth, as cost-based payment was replaced by prospective payment in Medicare, Medicaid and the private sector, and as managed care encouraged price competition, the evidence of regulatory cost savings dwindled and rate regulation virtually disappeared. While investment regulation is still widespread, its role and effect in the new hospital marketplace is still unclear.",I
"Chaloupka, Frank J.|Warner, Kenneth E.","Handbook of Health Economics","While the tobacco industry ranks among the most substantial and successful of economic enterprises, tobacco consumption is associated with more deaths than any other product. Economic analysis of the markets for tobacco products, particularly cigarettes, has contributed considerable insight to debates about the importance of the industry and the appropriate roles of public policy in grappling with the health consequences of tobacco. Certainly the most significant example of this phenomenon has been the rapidly expanding and increasingly sophisticated body of research on the effects of price increases on cigarette consumption. Because excise tax comprises an important component of price, the resultant literature has played a prominent role in legislative debates about using taxation as a principal tool to discourage smoking. In addition to informing legislative debates, this literature has contributed both theory and empirical evidence to the growing interest in modeling the demand for addictive products.This chapter examines this body of research in detail, as well as a variety of equity and efficiency concerns accompanying debates about cigarette taxation. Coverage also includes economic analysis of the role of other tobacco control policies, such as restrictions on advertising, of special interest due to their prominence in debates about tobacco control. The chapter concludes with consideration of research addressing the validity of the tobacco industry's argument that its contributions to employment, tax revenues, and trade balances are vital to the economic health of states and nations. This argument is one of the industry's principal weapons in its battle against policy measures intended to reduce tobacco product consumption.",I
"Cook, Philip J.|Moore, Michael J.","Handbook of Health Economics","Excess drinking is associated with lost productivity, accidents, disability, early death, crime, neglect of family responsibilities, and personality deterioration. These and related concerns have justified special restrictions on alcoholic-beverage commerce and consumption. The nature and extent of government involvement in this arena vary widely over time and place, and are often controversial. Economists have contributed to the evaluation of alcohol policy through empirical work on the effects of alcohol-control measures on consumption and its consequences. Economics has also provided an accounting framework for defining and comparing costs and benefits of interventions, including excise taxes.Outside of the policy arena, economists have analyzed alcohol consumption in the context of stretching the standard model of consumer choice to include intertemporal effects and social influence. Nonetheless, perhaps the most important contribution by economists has been the repeated demonstration that there is nothing unusual about alcohol in at least one essential respect: consumers drink less ethanol (and have fewer alcohol-related problems) when alcohol-beverage prices are increased.Important econometric challenges remain, including the search for a satisfactory resolution to the conflicting results on the effect of price changes on consumption by consumers who tend to drink heavily. There are also unresolved puzzles about the relationship between drinking and productivity; even after controlling for a variety of other characteristics, drinkers tend to have higher earnings than abstainers, and women's earnings (but not men's) tend to increase with alcohol consumption.",I
"Kenkel, Donald S.","Handbook of Health Economics","Prevention ranges from medical decisions such as vaccinations and clinical preventive services delivered during periodic health examinations to private health lifestyle decisions such as regular exercise and non-smoking. The aim of this chapter is to provide an overview of economic issues that cut across a variety of prevention decisions. After discussing what prevention means, the chapter reviews some basic theoretical insights about prevention from human capital models and insurance models. Consumer or household behavior receives most of the attention, partly because there is not an identifiable industry that produces prevention viewed broadly. The chapter next explores market failures that might lead to too little prevention from a societal perspective: ex ante moral hazard from health insurance, externalities from vaccinations, lack of consumer information, and the public good aspects of prevention-related research and development. Health economics provides some conceptual and empirical arguments for policies to encourage prevention. However, the economic perspective often remains quite different from the perspective of many public health professionals who are strong advocates of prevention. With that distinction in mind, the chapter then turns to policy-relevant questions of whether prevention can reduce total medical expenditures, and the effectiveness of policy interventions to encourage prevention. The chapter concludes with some reflections on what economics has offered and can offer to prevention research.",I
"Dolan, Paul","Handbook of Health Economics","An important consideration when establishing priorities in health care is the likely effect that alternative allocations will have on the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of the relevant population. This chapter considers some of the important issues surrounding the description and valuation of HRQoL. It discusses six main questions that need to be addressed when measuring HRQoL: What is to be valued?; How is it to be described?; How is it to be valued?; Who is to value it?; How are values for all health states to be generated?; and How are valuations to be aggregated? Since it is difficult to answer many of these questions on theoretical grounds alone, the chapter considers whether the existing empirical evidence can provide more definitive answers. Many important yet unresolved issues emerge and directions for future research are suggested. It is argued that this research agenda should have the gathering and analysis of qualitative data at its forefront.",I

"Williams, Alan|Cookson, Richard","Handbook of Health Economics","Equity in health has to be distinguished from equity in access to health care, or equity in the distribution of health care resources. We take as a working definition of health for our purposes the number of quality adjusted life years that a person may expect to enjoy over his or her lifetime. Although we mostly follow the economists' custom of regarding equity as synonymous with reducing inequalities in health, we also consider the much richer variety of concepts employed by philosophers when discussing distributive justice. Here however we have distinguished notions of justice which are essentially procedural from those which are substantive, concentrating mainly on the latter. What we have sought to do is to identify the implications of various philosophical theories of justice for the way in which a welfare economist might appraise a particular distribution of health within a community. To do this we distinguish theories which place constraints on admissible outcomes (the health opportunity set), from theories which require the social welfare function (or maximand) to have particular properties. This classification is summarised in the Table 1, which is the key exhibit around which the analysis and exposition is organised.",I

"Eberts, Randall W.|McMillen, Daniel P.","Handbook of Regional and Urban Economics","This chapter reviews the theoretical and empirical literature on agglomeration economies and urban public infrastructure. Theory links the two concepts by positing that agglomeration economies exist when firms in an urban area share a public good as an input to production. One type of shareable input is the close proximity of businesses and labor, that generates positive externalities which in turn lower the production cost of one business as the output of other businesses increases. The externalities result from businesses sharing nonexcludable inputs, such as a common labor pool, technical expertise, general knowledge and personal contacts. Another perhaps more tangible type of shareable input is urban public infrastructure. Public capital stock, such as highways, water treatment facilities, and communication systems, directly affect the efficient operation of cities by facilitating business activities and improving worker productivity.The literature has devoted considerable attention to both topics, but not together. Studies of agglomeration economies in several countries find that manufacturing firms are more productive in large cities than in smaller ones. Studies of the effect of infrastructure on productivity show positive, but in some cases statistically insignificant, effects of public capital stock on productivity. Most of these studies are at the national and state levels. Only a handful of studies have focused on the metropolitan level, and even fewer have estimated agglomeration economies and infrastructure effects simultaneously. Results from studies that include both types of shared inputs suggest that both spatial proximity and physical infrastructure contribute positively to the productivity of firms in urban areas. More research is needed to explore the interrelationships between urban size and urban public infrastructure and to open the black box of agglomeration economies and estimate how the various other factors associated with urban size affect productivity.",R
"Crampton, Graham R.","Handbook of Regional and Urban Economics","The large research literature in urban labour market analysis is reviewed, with the emphasis ranging from attempts to model aggregate simultaneous interactions between residential and workplace location to more modern econometric work researching individual labour market behaviour. The job search process is central to the operation of the labour market, yet research is hampered by variable data availability and the limited observability of the search mechanism. Individual responses to major employer relocations have been recently studied, especially the substitutability of the move or quit decision, and relationships to race and gender.The variation of commuting patterns by income and professional status has also been analysed, and the functioning of the dispersed service-dominated modern urban labour market raises challenging research issues including willingness to search and commute over substantial areas, interacting with family circumstances and expected job security.The continued growth in all developed economies of female labour force participation and numbers of female-headed households have raised the importance of urban labour market research focusing on gender, including the economic understanding of patterns in the length of the female journey to work.Study of the influence of racial segregation on outcomes in the urban labour market has a longer history, with the spatial mismatch hypothesis having developed a large literature since the 1960s. With higher quality microdata and modern computational power and econometric techniques, statistical research has advanced considerably. Similar spatial relationships between race and labour market and commuting outcomes are also intrinsic to the European urban labour market, and have received particular attention from British, Dutch, Austrian and French researchers.

"Whitehead, Christine M.E.","Handbook of Regional and Urban Economics","This chapter examines certain of the developments in the application of economic theory and in empirical and policy analysis with respect to housing markets in general and urban housing markets in particular. The majority of the material refers to US and UK experience with some English language contributions related to other, mainly European, countries.The main thrust of the chapter is to clarify how the particular attributes of housing, especially those of durability and locational specificity, have been introduced into microeconomic models of housing. On the demand side analysis concentrates on estimates of price and income elasticities and the results that arise from different mode specifications. On the supply side there is emphasis on the importance of distinguishing the factors determining new supply from those which affect investment in the existing stock. Overall housing market analysis is also divided into that which applies to the market as a whole and the very different issues, particularly with respect to market segmentation, which dominate urban models.Turning to housing policy the chapter clarifies the different approaches taken to analysis, measurement and evaluation of policy in Europe and America and examines in detail developments with respect to particular examples of policy concern, including market versus administrative allocation, housing and labour markets, the impact of local taxation and rent control.",R

The first is the control of development, of which the most studied form is zoning, but we also consider the designation of conservation areas and the effects of growth controls. Growth control may raise the price of land, allowing an infrastructure charge to be made or growth may be limited by charging impact fees. The second kind of intervention aims to increase the supply of land, either by direct action, as in the Netherlands, through compulsory purchase or eminent domain, or through the reallocation of land ownership as in land readjustment schemes.",R
"Becker, Charles M.|Morrison, Andrew R.","Handbook of Regional and Urban Economics","The past half-century has witnessed a dramatic change in the way in which people live. Fifty years ago, only a small proportion of the less developed world lived in cities, and world poverty was overwhelmingly rural. In 1950, less than one-fifth of the population of the third world was urban; in the next five years or so, a majority of developing countries' populations will be urban. This dramatic social change has captured the attention of development economists and, to a lesser degree, urban economists. This chapter examines what has been learned in a variety of areas. Section 1 discusses the stylized patterns of urbanization in the developing world, while Section 2 turns to models of third world city growth and their empirical estimates, discussing partial equilibrium models, general equilibrium models, economy-wide computable general equilibrium (CGE) models, demographic-economic perspectives, and household migration modeling. Section 3 considers the impact of government policies on urbanization. Particular attention is devoted to structural adjustment policies, urban biases in public expenditures, and issues unique to (ex)-socialist economies. Section 4 examines structural impediments to urban development, including labor and land markets, transportation issues, public finance and social infrastructure concerns, and urban spatial structure. The final section looks at the macroeconomic impacts of urbanization--on wage gaps and income distribution, demand patterns and economic efficiency.1",R
"Malpezzi, Stephen","Handbook of Regional and Urban Economics","The purpose of this chapter is to survey recent research on housing markets and policy in what used to be called the second and third worlds. We adopt the labels transition economies to refer to countries as disparate as Russia and Vietnam, and developing to refer to countries as disparate as Korea and Singapore (arguably now developed) and countries like Mozambique and Laos. It is therefore quite interesting that the bulk of the research surveyed finds that housing market behavior is remarkably similar from place to place. Institutions and constraints, particularly the amount of income available for housing and other goods and services certainly do vary dramatically from place to place. And the stakes of how well housing markets work vary from place to place. But these differences in institutions and constraints do not obscure regularities in behavior. The first major section, on housing markets (Section 2), examines property rights, supply, demand and tenure. Section 3 presents research on the related markets for land, finance and infrastructure.

"Ross, Stephen|Yinger, John","Handbook of Regional and Urban Economics","This chapter reviews the literature on the boundary between urban economics and local public finance, defined as research that considers both a housing market and the market for local public services. The first part of the chapter considers positive theories. This part presents the consensus model of the allocation of households to jurisdictions, which is built on bid functions and household sorting, as well as alternative approaches to this issue. It also examines models of local tax and spending decisions, which exhibit no consensus, and reviews research in which both housing and local fiscal variables are endogenous. The second part of the chapter considers empirical research, with a focus on tax and service capitalization, on household heterogeneity within jurisdictions, and on the impact of zoning. The third part considers normative theories about a decentralized system of local governments. This part examines the extent to which such a system leads to an efficient allocation of households to communities or efficient local public service levels, and it discusses the fairness of local public spending. This review shows that the bidding/sorting framework is strongly supported by the evidence and has wide applicability in countries with decentralized governmental systems. In contrast, models of local public service determination depend on institutional detail, and their connections with housing markets have been largely unexplored in empirical work. Ever since Tiebout (1956), many scholars have argued that decentralized local governments have efficiency advantages over centralized forms. However, a general treatment of this issue identifies four key sources of inefficiency even in a decentralized system: misallocation of households to communities, the property tax, public service capitalization and heterogeneity. Few policies to eliminate these sources of inefficiency have yet been identified. Finally, this review explores the equity implications of household sorting and other features of a decentralized system.",R

An important aspect of these externalities that has not been previously emphasized is that the effects of agglomeration extend over at least three different dimensions. These are the industrial, geographic, and temporal scope of economic agglomeration economies. In each case, the literature suggests that agglomeration economies attenuate with distance. Recently, the literature has also begun to provide evidence on the microfoundations of external economies of scale. The best known of these sources are those attributed to Marshall (1920): labor market pooling, input sharing, and knowledge spillovers. Evidence to date supports the presence of all three of these forces. In addition, there is also evidence that natural advantage, home market effects, consumption opportunities, and rent-seeking all contribute to agglomeration.",R

"Moretti, Enrico","Handbook of Regional and Urban Economics","What is the effect of an increase in the overall level of human capital on the economy of a city? Although much is known about the private return to education, much less is known about the more important question of what happens to productivity, wages and land prices when the aggregate stock of human capital in a city increases. Increases in the aggregate stock of human capital can benefit society in ways that are not fully reflected in the private return of education. Human capital spillovers can in theory increase aggregate productivity over and above the direct effect of human capital on individual productivity. Furthermore, increases in education can reduce criminal participation and improve voters' political behavior. In this chapter, I review what we know about social returns to education, with a particular emphasis on those externalities that accrue to local geographic areas. The focus of the chapter is on the empirical issues that arise in identifying these externalities and on the existing empirical evidence on their magnitude.",R
"Abdel-Rahman, Hesham M.|Anas, Alex","Handbook of Regional and Urban Economics","Economic theories of systems of cities explain why production and consumption activities are concentrated in a number of urban areas of different sizes and industrial composition rather than uniformly distributed in space. These theories have been successively influenced by four paradigms: (i) conventional urban economics emphasizing the tension between economies due to the spatial concentration of activity and diseconomies arising from that concentration; (ii) the theory of industrial organization as it relates to inter-industry linkages and to product differentiation; (iii) the New Economic Geography which ignores land markets but emphasizes trade among cities, fixed agricultural hinterlands and the endogenous emergence of geography; (iv) the theory of endogenous economic growth. Among the issues examined are specialization versus diversification of cities in systems of cities, how city systems contribute to increasing returns in national and the global economies, the factors that determine skill distribution and income disparity between cities, the impacts of income disparity on welfare, whether population growth should cause economic activity to become more or less concentrated in urban areas, and how resources should be allocated efficiently in a system of cities. Related to the last issue, we consider models where cities are organized by local planners or developers as well as cities that self-organize by atomistic actions. A conclusion of the theoretical study of city systems is that markets fail in efficiently allocating resources across cities when certain intercity interactions are present and that a role for central planning may be necessary.",R

"Epple, Dennis|Nechyba, Thomas","Handbook of Regional and Urban Economics","Fiscal decentralization is on the rise worldwide while barriers to factor and population mobility are declining. Greater decentralized government activity is therefore taking place in an economic environment characterized by increased competition for mobile resources, and government policy within this environment is increasingly cognizant of profound implications this combination of decentralization and mobility may have on political and economic outcomes. As these trends have become important, the academic literature across several disciplines in economics has paid increasing attention to the issues that arise from these trends. This chapter summarizes the progress that has been made in this literature -- in both theoretical and empirical dimensions -- while simultaneously pointing out some open questions for future research. Several important themes emerge: First, while simple versions of more general models have clarified many analytic issues, policy trade-offs are ultimately made in complicated settings rich with institutional detail. Thus, the search for a greater connection between theoretical models and data has taken on particular importance. Complex general equilibrium models of fiscal decentralization ultimately become most useful when underlying parameters within such models are determined by the data. Both calibration and structural estimation techniques are advancing this portion of the literature. Second, the last decade has seen an increasing emphasis on political forces in debates over fiscal decentralization. Not only does such decentralization carry with it potential economic benefits and costs, but political decisions are likely to be fundamentally different in a decentralized environment. Important further work on political institutions under fiscal decentralization is needed. Finally, as decentralization has been studied in multiple contexts, it has become increasingly clear that the micro-foundations of local goods and services need further theoretical and empirical investigations. Many such goods (such as crime prevention and schooling) depend on peer and neighborhood effects, and predictions can change fundamentally as such effects are introduced.",R
"Glaeser, Edward L.|Kahn, Matthew E.","Handbook of Regional and Urban Economics","Cities can be thought of as the absence of physical space between people and firms. As such, they exist to eliminate transportation costs for goods, people and ideas and transportation technologies dictate urban form. In the 21st century, the dominant form of city living is based on the automobile and this form is sometimes called sprawl. In this essay, we document that sprawl is ubiquitous and that it is continuing to expand. Using a variety of evidence, we argue that sprawl is not the result of explicit government policies or bad urban planning, but rather the inexorable product of car-based living. Sprawl has been associated with significant improvements in quality of living, and the environmental impacts of sprawl have been offset by technological change. Finally, we suggest that the primary social problem associated with sprawl is the fact that some people are left behind because they do not earn enough to afford the cars that this form of living requires.",R

"Ottaviano, Gianmarco|Thisse, Jacques-Francois","Handbook of Regional and Urban Economics","Peaks and troughs in the spatial distributions of population, employment and wealth are a universal phenomenon in search of a general theory. Such spatial imbalances have two possible explanations. In the first one, uneven economic development can be seen as the result of the uneven distribution of natural resources. This is sometimes called 'first nature' and refers to exogenously given characteristics of different sites. However, it falls short of providing a reasonable explanation of many other clusters of activities, which are much less dependent on natural advantage. The aim of geographical economics is precisely to understand what are the economic forces that, after controlling for first nature, account for 'second nature', which emerges as the outcome of human beings' actions to improve upon the first one. Specifically, geographical economics asks what are the economic forces that can sustain a large permanent imbalance in the distribution of economic activities. In this paper, we focus on the so-called 'new economic geography' approach. After having described some of the main results developed in standard location theory, we use a unified framework to survey the home market effect as well as core-periphery models. These models have been criticized by geographers because they account for some spatial costs while putting others aside without saying why. Furthermore, core-periphery models also exhibit some extreme features that are reflected in their bang-bang outcomes. We thus move on by investigating what the outcomes of core-periphery models become when we account for a more complete and richer description of the spatial aspects that these models aim at describing. We conclude by suggesting new lines of research.",R

The growth analog to this result is that the introduction of endogenous growth in the same type of new trade model can lead to the same result. A difference with the labour mobility version is that the results are easier to derive from the analytical point of view in the endogenous growth version. We show that the relation between growth and agglomeration depends crucially on capital (human or physical) mobility between regions. The absence of capital mobility is at the heart of the possibility of spatial agglomeration with catastrophe. In addition, growth alters the process of location even without catastrophe. In particular, and contrary to the fundamentally static models of the New Economic Geography, spatial concentration of economic activities may be consistent with a process of delocation of firms towards poor regions. Finally, the presence of localized technology spillovers implies that spatial agglomeration is conducive to growth.",R
"Audretsch, David B.|Feldman, Maryann P.","Handbook of Regional and Urban Economics","This chapter focuses on the geographic dimensions of knowledge spillovers. The starting point comes from the economics of innovation and technological change. This tradition focused on the innovation production function however it was aspatial or insensitive to issues involving location and geography. However, empirical results hinted that knowledge production had a spatial dimension. Armed with a new theoretical understanding about the role and significance of knowledge spillovers and the manner in which they are localized, scholars began to estimate the knowledge production function with a spatial dimension. Location and geographic space have become key factors in explaining the determinants of innovation and technological change. The chapter also identifies new insights that have sought to penetrate the black box of geographic space by addressing a limitation inherent in the model of the knowledge production. These insights come from a rich tradition of analyzing the role of both localization and urbanization economies, by extending the focus to the organization of economic activity within a spatial dimension and examine how different organizational aspects influence economic performance. While the endogenous growth theory emphasizes the importance of investments in research and development and human capital, a research agenda needs to be mapped out identifying the role that investments in spillover conduits can make in generating economic growth. It may be that a mapping of the process by which new knowledge is created, externalized and commercialized, hold the key to providing the microeconomic linkages to endogenous macroeconomic growth.",R
"Magrini, Stefano","Handbook of Regional and Urban Economics","Do regions converge? This essay provides an overview of the key developments in the study of regional convergence, discussing the methodological issues that have arisen since the first attempts to analyse convergence and critically surveying the results that have been obtained for different regional systems. Two underlying arguments will guide the attempt to reach an answer: (i) not all empirical approaches to the analysis of convergence appear equally reliable and not all results equally convincing; (ii) although most regional convergence studies make use of empirical methods originally developed to analyse cross-country convergence, regions and countries are far from interchangeable concepts. The picture that emerges from this particular perspective is one in which convergence is often confined to groups of geographically contiguous regions.",R
"Holmes, Thomas J.|Stevens, John J.","Handbook of Regional and Urban Economics","In this chapter we discuss the data sources and methods available for studying the spatial distribution of economic activity in North America. We document facts about the specialization of states and regions, as well as locations differentiated by their degree of urbanization. We also report characteristics of the industries in which locations specialize. For example, establishment size and materials intensity are shown to vary in systematic ways with regional specialization. With these facts as a backdrop, we begin to consider the question, Why do locations specialize as they do?",R

(ii) To present descriptive evidence on the location of aggregate activity and particular industries and to consider how these location patterns are changing over time. (iii) To consider the nature of the agglomeration and dispersion forces that determine these patterns and to contrast them to forces acting elsewhere, particularly in the U.S. Our survey suggests that much has been achieved in the wave of empirical work that has occurred in the past decade, but that much work remains to be done.",R
"Fujita, Masahisa|Mori, Tomoya|Henderson, J. Vernon|Kanemoto, Yoshitsugu","Handbook of Regional and Urban Economics","In this chapter we look at the spatial distribution of economic activities in China and Japan. Japan has excellent data and relatively uniform institutions since World War II, which allow us to track its spatial evolution and detail its key features today. For Japan we show how structural shifts in the national economy involved major transformations of the regional structure of economic activity. We address a central policy issue, the high extent of urban agglomeration in Tokyo. Then we turn to the details of the spatial distribution of industrial activity across cities, to see what general patterns hold and what they imply for our understanding of the role of different cities in the urban hierarchy. For China the approach is different. With the radical institutional changes since 1978 moving China away from being a planned economy, there is little consistency in data definitions and coverage over time and less detailed data are available. We focus on the last decade and on policy issues. We observe that Chinese cities tend to be overcapitalized and undersized, with strong spatial biases to policies, concerning migration, capital allocations, infrastructure allocations and location of FDI.",R

The analysis is framed in terms of two geographic scales: regions and cities. The compelling reason for studying geographic area of two different scales is that models that explain location of economic activities at one scale may not apply to other scales. We consider the process of settling the frontier; the development of national markets in goods and factors and, more generally, the convergence (and divergence) of regional economies; the growth of cities and the relationship between urbanization and trends in aggregate economic structure, such as industrialization; and changes in the internal structure of cities",R
"Hohenberg, Paul M.","Handbook of Regional and Urban Economics","Over a millennium Europe has become largely urban. While urban growth, absolute and as a percentage of a growing population, has been as dramatic as economic change, many elements of continuity tie the present to the past. This evolution with path dependence is highlighted if one looks at European urban economies in terms of a dual systems model combining central place and network relationships. After the medieval push of town creation and differentiation, the early modern period saw a slowing of the increase in urban population and proportion, even as cities anchored the growth of overseas trade and of integrated territorial states. Growth was concentrated in major ports and capital or court cities. The role of cities in the rise of a market economy capable of sustained growth in output per head is tied to ongoing debates about how and why growth began in Europe, and within Europe in England. Industrialization led to enormous increases in urban agglomeration driven by transport improvements and increasing returns to scale in manufacturing as well as distribution. However, leadership functions tended to concentrate in giant capital cities rather than in the new industrial towns and conurbations. Within cities, rapid in-migration and lags in institutions and technology for urban management aggravated crowding and squalor. Conditions improved toward the turn of the 20th century, thanks in part to electricity and to more responsive and active government, as well as to slower urbanization. The depression and destruction of the 1914-1945 period was followed by great prosperity and enormous building. The information age appears to have conflicting impacts on agglomeration in Europe, with policy leaning toward sustaining dense cities (relative at least to the U.S.). The shift from older to newer industries, as well as growth in leisure and high human capital pursuits, has shifted activity away from many 19th century industrial centers and toward revitalized older cities and urbanized regions with higher amenity levels.",R

From the very beginning, the goal was to protect ownership interests and limit management interests. In order to better enforce ownership interests, the use of auditors became prevalent.

"Lívia Pavlik","Calculating Prime Costs Under the New Framework of Public Finances Accounting. The Special Features of Higher Education","At the end of last year the government adopted the new higher education strategy. The gear shifting strategy in higher education was soon followed by the regulation swinging into high gear on 1 January 2014, which affected the accounting system of budgetary institutions. Accrual-based accounting was introduced in the budgetary sector, which can significantly help achieve the objectives set in the higher education strategy, creating an information base for a management-oriented governance model based on performance measurement. The possibility is now available, but the extent to which the sector can take advantage of the extra information in managing the institutional system remains to be seen. Government Decree No. 4/2013 created the possibility of prime costs calculation based on a closed accounting information base, thereby making it possible to measure the performance of each period on the basis of the actual use of resources. In addition to discussing the special features of the regulatory environment, this paper addresses the theoretical and methodological issues of prime costs calculation, including the definition of different prime cost contents for each objective and assessing the possibilities of allocating general costs.",M

This paper is designed to compare how the transformation or dissolution without succession of business associations differs from the main features of the transformation of budgetary institutions with special regard to the features of the ownership structure of these economic entities. (Xantus, 2010) The structural changes are reviewed in the framework of the double double-entry bookkeeping method that combines accrual-based and cash-based accounting with a view also to changes in the legislative background of this transformation that occurred simultaneously with the preparations being made at the institutions. The paper highlights the cyclic nature of higher education activities that should be treated as a crucial factor in choosing the effective date of the changes.",M

Another objective was to assess whether the Hungarian accounting regulations support the disclosure of such information. We applied the measurement methodology presented by Ragini (2012). Our main conclusion is that the reporting culture of the Hungarian companies within the sample is determined by the mandatory minimum content prescribed by law. Voluntary disclosure of data is more characteristic of listed companies. We have also found that the companies comprising the sample tend to elaborate more on topics such as shareholders, the environment, or intangibles included in their balance sheets. However, they scored less in areas such as research and development, market and customer and strategy and competition.",M

The focus of the research is on the attitude and behaviour of Turkish female entrepreneurs in Amsterdam. The main fascinating question is: Are ethnic female entrepreneurs special ethnic entrepreneurs or special female entrepreneurs? This paper provides an answer to this question on the basis of field surveys. The results of the case study research on Turkish female entrepreneurs in Amsterdam show that the ethnic female profile is a special female profile and that Turkish female entrepreneurs are special female entrepreneurs, particularly in terms of personal and business characteristics, driving forces and motivations. They appear to combine their ethnic opportunities with their personal characteristics (and other opportunities) in the urban market, and to have a successful performance. This is also caused by the fact that they have become service providers not only for their own ethnic groups, but also for other groups in the city.Keywords: Ethnic female entrepreneurship, diversity in entrepreneurship, ethnic female profile, Turkish female entrepreneurs",M

After providing a short description of the global leather footwear industry, the first section provides insights into the competitive advantages of different countries, characteristics of developing country exporters and the difference between large and small European buyers of Indian leather footwear. The subsequent section provides an insight into the different chains of influence that exist in trying to make international trade more sustainable with the help of a broad understanding of the means, their effectiveness, their constraints and a few examples of such chains of influence. Section four studies whether ecolabels are in a position to be suitable indicators of sustainability. Further it delves into understanding the perspectives of consumers, producers and regulators on whether ecolabels are useful in promoting sustainable exports. The explanation of how ecolabels conflict with brand dynamics is quite interesting. The policy measures provide clear options for targeting sustainable production. Suggestions include use of eco-elasticity indicator, toolbox approach to environment policy, introducing comprehensive sustainability labels, maintaining a level of mandatory legislations as well as a constructive effort to increase transparency in supply chains.

The decomposition is carried out for 1986-88 for an extensive data set covering 10 pollutants, 48 countries and 79 ISIC 4-digit sectors. Illustrative decompositions presented for 3 of the 10 pollutants in the data set indicate a significant pollution haven effect and highlight the role of factor endowments in each regions PCI. However, because the bulk of trade is intra-regional with a high North-North share, these effects are small relative to the deep determinants of the worldwide pollution content of trade.",F

One interesting feature of the conjoint choice questions for members of the public is that the responses to these questions can be used to estimate the social benefits of regeneration projects, i.e., how much people are willing to pay for these urban transformations. Another advantage of our approach is that it can be used seek and foster broader public participation into urban decisionmaking processes.",R

The paper uses a model, developed by Tabuchi (1993), in which road transport presents a bottleneck congestion technology while railroad transport shows economies of scale with respect to the number of train users. The competition between the two modes is assumed to be on cost basis only. It is found that if the railroad fare is set equal to the average cost, the relative efficiency of the regimes depends on parameters' values. The numerical simulation shows that the fine toll regime is generally to be preferred to the alternative regimes but when the fixed railroad cost is large enough so that the inefficient exploitation of the scale economies is less than compensated by the toll revenue.",R

"Filipe J. Sousa|Luís M. de Castro","Relationship significance: is it sufficiently explained?","The Industrial Networks Theory (cf. Axelsson and Easton, 1992, Hakansson and Snehota, 1995) sets out to describe and explain the business relationships and markets in which the focal firm is deeply embedded. One of its major propositions pertains to the (time-varying) significance of business relationships for the focal firm (Gadde et al., 2003), i.e., business relationships influence to some extent the focal firms survival. Such significance seems strongly related to the role played by business relationships and consequently the relationship outcomes accruing to the focal firm. The theoretical justification underlying this proposition is outwardly oriented, somewhat overlooking the inside of the focal firm - in particular the influence of business relationships on what the focal firm does competently within and across its boundaries. Arguably, the creation and appropriation of relationship value by the focal firm is a necessary but not sufficient condition for relationship significance. A supplementary (internal) explanation supported by Knowledge-based Theories of the Firm (e.g., see Kogut and Zander, 1992), we suggest, may be missing. Our aim here has been to intuitively pinpoint a theoretical flaw, further suggesting a feasible path for its solution.",M
"Aurora A.C. Teixeira","Entrepreneurial potential in Business and Engineering courses  why worry now?","Research on entrepreneurship potential targeting university students is emerging. However, it is in general focused on one school-one course. Few studies analyze the differences in entrepreneurial propensity between students of different subjects. In this paper we analyze the magnitude of this propensity in engineering and economics/business courses. The reason for such focus is that traditionally these courses are viewed as the ones concentrating individuals that are more likely to create new ventures. The empirical results, based on a large-scale survey of 2430 final-year students, reveal that no statistical difference exists in entrepreneurial potential of economics/business and engineering students, and that these two latter groups have lower entrepreneurial potential than students from other courses. This result proves to be quite unfortunate given the focus that previous studies have placed on these two majors, and the fact that a substantial part of entrepreneurial education is undertaken in business and engineering schools.",M
"Maria Antónia Rodrigues|João F. Proença","SST and the Consumer Behaviour in Portuguese Financial Services","Financial services, especially commercial banking has been introducing new self-service technologies (SST), in the contact with customers, which allows the customer to accede service in an autonomous and timeless form. This paper discusses the behaviour of users and non-users of self-service technologies (namely, ATMs, call center/telephone, and internet) in Portuguese banking services. An empirical study was carried out by means of a questionnaire. Data were collected on 300 individuals, representing a sample, by region, gender and age group, of the Portuguese population, age 18 and over, and living in mainland Portugal. The results call for a users profile and consumers behaviour of SST. The SST users reveal a higher intention of repurchase, propensity to complain and higher price sensibility than the non-users. They are younger and middle-aged individuals, with a medium and high level of education. The main contribution of the paper is that banking managers that invest in SST may expect more sales (as a result of consumers with higher intention of repurchase), more opportunities of recovering the service (as a result of consumers with higher propensity to complain), but more price competitiveness (as a result of a consumer behaviour more price sensible). The paper put in evidence that SST use is not sufficient to determine consumer satisfaction and positive word-of-mouth, and it is not a barrier to bank switching.",M
"Catarina Roseira|Carlos Brito","Value Co-Creation with Suppliers","The growing specialization of firms and the reinforcement of vertical disintegration have led to an increasing reliance on purchasing and supply management. This means that an increasing proportion of value is created outside the boundaries of the firm, namely by suppliers. In this context, the paper aims to relate the configuration of the bonds companies establish with their suppliers to the process of value creation. The paper furthers our understanding of buyer-supplier relationships as mechanisms for the coordination and development of capabilities on both sides of the dyad. Evidence was found that relationships affect not only the access and exploration of suppliers resources, but also the perception the buying firm has about their capabilities which is likely to condition the potential for joint value creation. The main contribution of the paper is that value co-creation involving suppliers must be regarded as a strategic option which depends on several conditions. This research puts in evidence two of these conditions: suppliers capabilities and the way the buyer-seller relationships are configured.",M
"Samuel Cruz Alves Pereira","Aggregation in activity-based costing and the short run activity cost function","This paper first identifies the conditions that support the construction of an aggregate output, i.e. the conditions under which a single measure of output can be used to accurately determine cost object incremental costs within a cost pool. This is a significant issue which has not been fully explored in the management accounting literature. Two conditions are jointly necessary and sufficient. The first one is the linear homogeneity property associated with each cost object production function. This condition ensures that costs are linear with output, which is essential if the cost reported by an activity-based costing (ABC) system is also to be a relevant cost for decision?making. The second is that all (cost object) cost driver rates for a given cost pool are equal. This condition guarantees that the cost function at a given activity depends on only one cost driver. The short run structure of ABC is also introduced. It is shown that the fundamental ABC property of linearly between costs and output does not generally hold in the short run, even assuming that technologies are linearly homogeneous. Only under very particular conditions, such as when inputs are combined in completely fixed proportions, are short run costs linear with output.",M
"Rute Gonçalves|Patrícia Lopes","Accounting in Agriculture: Disclosure practices of listed firms","This paper analyzes accounting in agriculture under the International Accounting Standard (IAS) 41  Agriculture of 270 listed firms worldwide that have adopted International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) until 2010. Previous empirical evidence on the implementation of this standard is still very scarce. In general it shows that the disclosure level is low and that comparability is missing. In order to extend previous research on disclosure practices under the IAS 41, an index of the disclosure of biological assets is constructed and calculated based in the 2011 annual report. This paper tests several hypotheses relating the index and firm-level determinants - biological assets intensity, ownership concentration, firm size, auditor type, internationalization level, listing status, profitability and sector  and country-level determinant - legal status. This variable is measured using two different proxies, following institutional country classification, namely the dichotomy common law versus code law countries and cluster classification (Leuz, 2010). It was found that the mandatory and voluntary disclosure of biological assets is influenced by biological assets intensity, ownership concentration, firm size, sector and legal status. This paper seeks to help standard setters to better understand disclosure practices and their determinants concerning biological assets, and to develop future projects on this issue.",M

Some of those studies emphasise the importance of the workload control in order to improve manufacturing operations. In this paper a multiple decision-making scheme, with the purpose of planning and controlling operations and getting better delivery and workload related performance measures, as well as one order release decision rule are proposed. The decision-making scheme includes four main decisions: (i) accept or reject an in-coming order; (ii) define the orders due date; (iii) release the accepted jobs; and (iv) dispatch the jobs at the station level. Extensive simulation experiments were performed to compare the proposed rule with the benchmark mechanisms, as well as with rules presented in previous studies. They led to the conclusion that considering the four decisions simultaneously can improve the job shop measures of performance, and that the proposed release rule is the best in almost all instances.",M

"Patrícia Teixeira Lopes|Lúcia Lima Rodrigues","Accounting for Financial Instruments: An Analysis of the Determinants of Disclosure in the Portuguese Stock Exchange","This paper analyzes the determinants of disclosure level in the accounting for financial instruments of Portuguese listed companies. We have constructed an index of disclosure based on IAS 32 and 39 disclosure requirements and computed the index score for each company.  Consequently, this study also analyzes the characteristics of companies that are closest to IAS before 2005. The analysis includes variables that capture intrinsic features of Portuguese companies and institutional regulatory context, such as capital structure and characteristics of the corporate governance structure, within contingency theory. We could not find significant influence of corporate governance structure and of financing structure. We conclude that disclosure degree is significantly related to size, type of auditor, listing status and to the economic sector. This research reveals areas for improvement of the Portuguese companies reporting practices and suggests areas for intervention of the Portuguese capital markets regulator in the context of mandatory IAS after 2005.",M
"Carlos Brito|Ricardo Correia","Regions as Networks: Towards a Conceptual Framework of Territorial Dynamics","Regions interact with multiple actors and industrial companies are one of the most important players in this interaction. By their strategic actions and relationships, companies are simultaneously present in different regions and influence a territorys dynamics and structure. Moreover, territorial characteristics are also a condition that can shape a companys action. This reciprocal influence is recognized by an emerging theoretical background of relational geography. Within the industrial network approach interest in this phenomenon is also increasing. However, the interactions between companies and regions have not been sufficiently explained. Thus, the main objective of this working paper is to produce new knowledge about the dynamics and interactions between regions and industrial networks. More precisely, the authors want to explain how companies strategic action is reflected in territorial dynamics and structure and how such factors affect the companies strategic action. Based on extensive research of the interactive relations between companies and regions, a model aimed at providing a better understanding of this mutual influence was developed.",R

"Cláudia Carvalho|Carlos Brito|José Sarsfield Cabral","Assessing the Quality of Public Services: A Conceptual Model","One of the major challenges faced by Public Administration is how to create more value for both citizens and firms, mainly because of the increasing budgetary constraints and challenging demands from society. In fact, over the past two decades there has been a general movement of public reform in most developed countries, and for this reason it is essential to understand how users assess the quality of public services. The aim of this paper is to clarify the determinants of public service quality. Due to the nature of the research problem, we have adopted a case-study methodology. The research involved extensive qualitative and quantitative data collection with managers, citizens and front and back-office public servants by means of interviews, questionnaires and focus groups. The paper presents the case of Public Service Citizens Shops (Loja do Cidadão) in Portugal, a recent and innovative channel for the delivery of public services. Firstly, it explores the kind of relationships that develop during the public service encounter between the citizen, the public organization and society. Secondly, citizen satisfaction and dissatisfaction with public services are both investigated. The basic premise is that these two concepts are not opposite but have different determinants. Furthermore, the paper also explores the nature of tolerance and emphasizes the importance of managing emotions in the public service encounter. Finally, it also considers how the quality assessment of public services should also take into account implications regarding value to society.",M
"Umesh Ramchandra Raut|Pedro Quelhas Brito","An analysis of brand relationship with the perceptive of customer based brand equity pyramid","The construct of a brand relationship is quite complex. Numerous types of brand relationships can be identify and each of them is associated with different emotions and norms. Works on relationship marketing implies that developing relationship between consumers and their preferred brand is important. The presence of strong brand in the market is the source of various financial rewards to organization and due to this, creation strong brand is top priority for many organizations. Brand resonance is the term which focuses on the various stages of consumer brand relationship through which consumer connected with brand.  Our move toward a science of consumer-brand relationships presents many challenges, many doubts that something so idiosyncratic can be brought to the level of generalizability that science requires. Literature of branding verify that the brand resonance is not depends on one thing only; it shows the impact of many brand related factors. Marketers must know the nature and mode of the consumers relationship with their brand. This study presents the brief discussion on brand resonance with help of literature of branding.",M

This is important because accounting information guides investment decisions (Bradshaw et al., 2004 and Verdi, 2006). For 17 European countries, findings confirm the mechanical relationship between accruals and accounting measures of performance: income increasing abnormal accruals, which mean decreasing accounting quality, will increase ROA and vice-versa. In addition, the lag effect is analysed, as per Chan et al. (2004). When current performance is compared with the abnormal accruals of the previous year, results suggest that the reverse effect does not occur for two consecutive years.",M
"Raquel Meneses|Carlos Brito","A DYNAMIC APPROACH TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF INTERNATIONAL NEW VENTURES","The competitive and organizational behavior of new firms has changed dramatically. Firms do not need to be big to internationalize, International New Ventures (INV) are a reality. But, they are characterized by the liability of newness and the liability of smallness. Since the nineties, scholars have devoted considerable attention to this phenomenon, but no one explains how these companies can overcome these constraints and internationalize. In this context, this paper uses a multilevel analysis, resulting in a more integrative framework. This approach extends the literature including, at the same time, the firm perspective (following the studies developed in Uppsala and the RBV), the organizational network approach and the international entrepreneur perspective. It has three units of observation and one of analysis. To understand INV dynamics it seems very important to observe, study and relate firm with network and entrepreneur. This research finds out that the entrepreneur plays a particularly important role in these new companies, ill-equipped (of relations, resources and knowledge), but the entrepreneur does not act in a vacuum; he is part of a firm integrated in a network. To internationalize early firms must use indirect knowledge, resources and history from organizational networks and from the entrepreneur.",M
"Filipe J. Sousa|Luís M. de Castro","Of the significance of business relationships","The Industrial Network Theory aims to describe and explain the business relationships and networks in which the focal firm is deeply embedded. One of its major propositions is that business relationships somehow influence, to different extents and over time, the focal firms survival. This pertains to the diverse and time-varying significance of business relationships for the focal firm. It has often been implicitly sustained that such significance is strongly related to the role played by business relationships and consequently the relationship outcomes accruing to the focal firm. The logic underlying the relationship significance proposition is outwardly oriented, somewhat overlooking the focal firms inside and in particular the conspicuous influence of business relationships on what the focal firm does competently both within and across its vertical boundaries. Arguably, the (predominantly functional) network-based arguments currently advanced represent a necessary but not sufficient condition for relationship significance. This conceptual paper tentatively suggests that there may be missing a supplementary (essentially internal) explanation supported by Competence-based Theories of the Firm.",M

"Rute Gonçalves|Patrícia Lopes","Accounting in Agriculture: Measurement practices of listed firms","Based on the International Accounting Standard (IAS) 41  Agriculture, this paper examines measurement practices of biological assets and their drivers, under accounting choice theory, given data from 2012. Taking into consideration 324 listed firms worldwide that have adopted International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) until 2011, the empirical evidence supports that while a large number of firms measures biological assets at fair value, there are others that refute the presumption of fair value reliability and measure biological assets at historical cost. The research model includes a binary dependent variable for the measurement practice (fair value or historical cost) and explores several factors that are expected to be related to the measurement of biological assets, namely, a country-level variable  legal status and firm-level variables  biological assets intensity, firm size, listing status, regulation expertise, potential growth, leverage and sector. It was found that the adoption of fair value measurement of biological assets is positively influenced by all variables, except by the negative impact of potential growth and by the absence of relationship with leverage. This paper seeks to help standard setters to better understand measurement practices, their drivers and constraints concerning biological assets, given the current discussion under the IAS 41.",M
"Rute Gonçalves|Patrícia Lopes","Value-Relevance of Biological Assets under IFRS","Using 389 firm-year observations of listed firms worldwide in 27 countries that adopted International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) until 2010, for the period 2011-2013, the purpose of this paper is to examine the value-relevance of fair value accounting of biological assets. In order to operationalize it as the book values ability to explain market equity value, this study adjusts the Ohlson model. The results support that recognized biological assets are value-relevant. After including the effect of the disclosure level of biological assets, the results show that biological assets are more value-relevant in firms that exhibit higher disclosure levels. Repeating this last analysis according to the classification bearer and consumable biological assets, the results are the same for bearer biological assets. For consumable biological assets, it seems that investors do not value recognized biological assets in firms that exhibit higher disclosure levels. Given the current adjustment in the International Accounting Standard 41 - Agriculture, under which firms will be permitted to choose either the cost or the revaluation models for mature bearer plants for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016, this paper seeks to help standard setters to better understand the market valuation implications of this standard.",M

We do not deny the existence of significant business relationships but sustain, in contrast to the consensus within the Markets-as-Networks Theory, that relationship significance should not be a self-evident assumption.

We use a list of 120 categories of inquiry and 370 possible responses and analyse companies annual reports. The results show that the majority of companies disclose the fair value amounts and methods of calculation but the information is neither clear nor objective, preventing the fair value information from being relevant and useful. We conclude that companies have a long way to go in terms of accounting and disclosure of financial instruments, namely derivatives. The mandatory adoption of more stringent standards such as the IAS 32 and IAS 39 may improve the information disclosed by companies. Doubts about the compliance degree and the usefulness of the information still remain. This paper brings new perspectives to the challenges of IAS/IFRS adoption, namely to what relates to fair value measurement.",M

"João A. Ribeiro|Robert W. Scapens","Management accounting and power: A contested relationship","This paper is structured in two parts. In the first part we undertake a brief discussion on the concept of power and we explore the way this concept has been regarded in several strands of literature on management accounting  the conventional, the contingency, the pluralist, the interpretive, the critical and the post-structuralist. Some of these strands  for instance, the pluralist, the critical and the post-structuralist  explicitly recognise the importance of (some conception of) power in their approach to management accounting in society and organisations. Other approaches are less explicit in that recognition or simply overlook/reject it. The second part of the paper takes sides, departing from the idea that there is a relationship between management accounting and power and proposes a framework for conceptualising that relationship. This framework attempts to bring together different dimensions/conceptions of power, and is proposed as a way to study management accounting and its change within organisations.",M

Pauly","Too Sick To Start: Health of the Entrepreneur and Business Entry in Townships around Durban, South Africa","Small businesses contribute a substantial share of economic activity in all countries, and may be an engine for job creation in developing economies. Unlike large firms with management teams, small businesses are usually run by one key person, the owner-entrepreneur, who bears almost all of the risks and who makes almost all of the decisions related to the business. Because the owner-entrepreneur also embodies most of the firm-specific knowledge capital, health of the owner-entrepreneur is an important factor contributing to the production process. Following a cohort of respondents with and without small businesses around Durban, South Africa, over a three-year period, our prior study found that poor baseline health and deteriorations in the health of the owner-entrepreneur were strongly associated with subsequent business exit. In the current study, we examined the relationship between an individuals physical health and the decision to start a business. Our results suggest that respondents who were recent business entrants were in better health than respondents who did not start new businesses. Moreover, respondents without a business at the beginning of the study but who later opened businesses during the three-year study interval were significantly more likely to have better health before business entry than those respondents who never started a new business. Hence, good health among entrepreneurs seems to be an important prerequisite to both small business survival and small business entry.",I

It concludes that the existing frameworks are very inadequate: in almost all the multilateral and preferential agreements focusing predominantly on trade (GATS Mode 4 and Preferential Trade Agreement), countries have made binding commitments only with respect to the temporary entry of high-skilled service providers.",F
"Yann Duval|Chorthip Utoktham","Trade Costs in Asia and the Pacific: Improved and Sectoral Estimates","There is ample evidence that successful implementation of bilateral or regional trade and economic integration initiatives would have a very significant impact on intraregional trade in Asia and the Pacific.  However, little is known about the level of intraregional trade costs in the region and to what extent these costs may have decreased over time.  This paper introduces new aggregate and sectoral estimates of bilateral trade costs in Asia and the Pacific available in an updated and extended version of the ESCAP Trade Cost Database (Version 2). The new data suggests that (1) most countries and subregions have made improvements in reducing trade costs; (2) Trade costs among Asian countries still often exceed the costs of trade of Asian countries with developed countries outside the region; and (3) tariff costs accounts for only a small portion of comprehensive trade costs  although tariff cuts account for a large share of overall trade cost reduction over the past decade.  At the sectoral level, agricultural trade costs are systematically found to exceed manufacturing trade costs, even when tariff costs are excluded. The fact that agricultural trade costs in many developing  countries are twice as high as their trade costs in manufactured goods suggest that focusing trade facilitation efforts on that sector may be particularly productive, especially given the importance of this sector for poverty reduction and more inclusive and sustainable development.",F

Results of the non-tariff policy-related trade costs modeling exercise strongly suggest that improving port efficiency (liner shipping connectivity) and access to information and communication technology facilities is essential to reducing trade costs.",F

A model of comprehensive trade costs is then developed and estimated using these specific indicators in an effort to identify policies and measures that have a significant effect on trade costs, and to prioritize them.  The trade costs between India and Mekong countries are found to be high: from 20% to 100% higher than those prevailing among Mekong countries.  However, the fact that India, China, Thailand, and most of the other India-Mekong countries made more progress in reducing trade costs with each other than with developed countries - such as Japan and the USA - is encouraging, showing signs of slow but steady improvements in regional connectivity.  Econometric results suggest that countries should prioritize policies aimed at further developing maritime and ICT services to reduce trade costs.",F

The important aspects of this publication relate to policy advisory with regard to the preparedness of LDCs as a group for successful negotiations at WTO. At the same time, given the high trade costs facing the LDCs, the study rightly suggests that they must capitalize on the successful implementation of the Trade Facilitation Agreement. Moreover, the study identifies the gaps in LDC capacities, and articulates the needs in terms of national and regional policies as well as capacity-building programmes for helping them to implement the Ministerial decisions in favour of the LDCs. The study also draws attention to what should be done towards achieving the finalization of the Doha Development Agenda Work Programme and the ongoing WTO negotiations.",F

In many cases, CSR has been abused as a marketing ploy, masking unsustainable practices of companies, in others it has simply constituted a charity event, again, often to mask the negative impacts of companies operations. However, the winds of change are blowing, in particular in the wake of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20). Increasingly, companies are adopting sustainable business practices as an integral element of their corporate strategies, which is the true meaning of CSR. In fact, some companies have gone beyond the traditional interpretation of CSR and either engage in social or impact investment and/or play active roles in development cooperation, including the provision of disaster relief and humanitarian assistance. In this regard, the concept of CSR has evolved and today is often referred to as corporate sustainability or responsible business practices to avoid confusion with the narrow (and wrong) interpretation of traditional CSR as charity events. Various global CSR instruments and sustainability frameworks, such as the Global Compact, Global Reporting Initiative and ISO 26000, have been in existence for some time and have been increasingly adopted by many companies, usually the bigger transnational corporations (TNCs). However, two main issues can be identified which require attention by both policymakers and companies. First, many companies in the Asia-Pacific region, in particular the millions of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), are slow to adopt CSR instruments as they are considered to undermine their competitiveness and belong to the realm of the public sector. Secondly, the increasing number of different CSR instruments and sustainability frameworks has led to a certain level of confusion and imposed cumbersome and duplicative reporting burdens on companies, and therefore some form of convergence is required. This publication looks at recent developments in CSR with particular attention to the growing role of impact investment and the need for greater convergence of global CSR instruments and provides recommendations to policymakers to enhance the adoption of CSR as an integral part of business strategy and operations.",F

The monograph starts with the presentation of trade related data of the 14 LDCs and the linkage between trade and economic development. Then the issue of market access is analyzed, followed by a study of the increasing protectionist measures faced by LDCs during the crisis period. In addition, reciprocal trade liberalization policies (bilateral, plurilateral and multilateral) are explored from various perspectives in order to better understand their differences, interaction and impact on LDCs and more developed countries. The latter is estimated in an econometric exercise using a gravity model. Finally, possible options to improve the capacity of LDCs to tap their trade potential and integrate more effectively into the global economy are discussed, including Aid for Trade.",F

The objective of this study is to explore the reasons for this by using Indias performance in the Asian IPNs as a case study for other countries that are trailing behind in this area. The study seeks to identify the reasons why India has performed below its potential in this new form of international division of labour, even though that country possess several supportive factors including: (a) the sheer size of the economy and population; (b) a large pool of engineers; (c) relatively sound intellectual property protection; and (d) an increasingly open trade and investment climate resulting from progressive economic reforms.",F
"Khan M. F. Salehin|Shamika Sirimanne","Facilitating Agricultural Trade in Asia and the Pacific","The growth of agricultural trade has direct implications for the Asia-Pacific region. Agricultural supply chains employ millions of people and there is a growing need for food commodities and high-value food products. The Asia-Pacific region is both a major consumer and producer of agricultural products. Its growth in both imports and exports is accelerating, but not to the potential. There is significant opportunity in this region to expand agro-trade especially due to population growth, dietary change of consumers and trade of high-value products. A number of constraints act as barriers to realizing the trade potential of the Asia-Pacific region: cumbersome trade procedures, inadequate compliance to product standards, poor trade logistics and lack of financing for agricultural trade. The status of least developed and landlocked developing countries are worse in many of these categories. Some Asia-Pacific countries have adopted effective measures to deal with their national bottlenecks, mostly based on simplifying procedures, introducing paperless trade transactions, improving quality infrastructure and introducing innovative financing mechanisms. Still, many countries in this region lag behind in facilitating agricultural trade and will need to adopt similar measures",F
"Ravi Ratnayake|Marc Proksch|Mia Mikic","Climate-Smart Trade and Investment in Asia and the Pacific - Towards a Triple-Win Outcome","Managing climate change caused by greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions has been recognized as one of the world's greatest challenges in current times, in particular in Asia and the Pacific which accounts for most of the world's GHG emissions. Without urgent action to curb such emissions, climate change will be more severe resulting in larger global temperature rises. Such temperature rises in turn are expected to result in extreme weather fluctuations and associated droughts and floods, melting of glaciers and rising sea levels affecting many countries, in particular coastal communities and rural areas. Trade and investment indirectly contribute to GHG emissions through the energy used in associated production and transportation processes to the extent that energy is generated on the basis of fossil fuels. However, if technologies can be developed and distributed which are clean and contribute to energy efficiency and conservation or use renewable energy, then trade and investment will be part of the solution rather than the problem. The publication therefore makes a strong case for trade and investment in climate-smart goods and services, in particular climate-smart technologies. This would result in a triple win for economic growth, trade and environment. The publication therefore discusses a holistic policy approach to promote trade and investment in climate-smart goods and services, including regional cooperation.",F

"Masato Abe|R.A. ATTALAGE|Masato Abe","Enabling Environment for the Successful Integration of Small and Medium Sized Enterprises in Global Value Chains","TSmall and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) have played an important role in South Asia and remain a critical source for employment creation as well as income generation. SMEs occupy an important position in the development strategy for inclusive economic growth and poverty reduction. In this respect, export-oriented SMEs, supplying competitive products and services with greater potential for backward and forward linkages, would substantially contribute towards higher national income and overall socio-economic progress of nations. Therefore, the development of export-led SMEs should be promoted through effective policy options in South Asian countries. However, SMEs in the subregion typically face considerable resource constraints and currently have limited capabilities to compete effectively in global and regional markets. It is thus imperative to further expand SMEs capacity and competitiveness for survival and sustained development, particularly in the current competitive business environment. Furthermore, one of the most crucial challenges facing SMEs in South Asia is how to create new business opportunities in the global and regional markets. Domestic SMEs can access international markets through global (and regional) value chains (GVCs), which provide a full range of value added business activities across borders. In order to participate in GVCs effectively, SMEs in South Asia must remove entry barriers by developing capacities in a wide range of increasingly stringent international standards with regard to quality, price and timely delivery of products. However, SMEs typically lack an environment that would allow them to improve their capacity and competitiveness. This publication aims to propose practical policy interventions in improving business environment by targeting three South Asian countries, namely Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka and facilitating SMEs access to global and regional markets, especially through GVCs.",F

Simplifying trade procedures and making them moretransparent has also been identified as a way to make international trade more inclusive, as this would make it easier for small and medium-sized enterprises to engage in importand export activities. At the same time, however, many trade facilitation measures identified for implementation in developing countries  often with the support of development agencies  involve the use of modern information and communications technologies (ICT), to which SMEs may not always have easy access",F

"Masato Abe","Globalization of Production and the Competitiveness of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises in Asia and the Pacific: Trends and Prospects","The principal aim of this publication is to fill a perceived gap in policy-related research and understanding of the development of the small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) sector in the Asia-Pacific region, in the context of a rapidly changing and mutating international business environment. To foster growing national economies, policymakers in virtually all countries are expected to facilitate the entry of new business ventures and to increase the competitiveness of SMEs. SMEs typically account for the vast majority of companies in an economy, create the majority of employment, and are responsible for a substantial number of technical innovations in various sectors. Thus, their growth and survival are critical for sustainable and inclusive socio-economic development under intensified global competition. However, the outbreak of the global economic crisis in 2008 added to the challenges faced by SMEsand policymakers seeking to support the SME sectorin an increasingly volatile international business environment. SME development is a key ingredient in the policy mix that will allow international business to return to healthy growth and permit Asia-Pacific economies to return to robust and inclusive growth. Although considerable research has already been undertaken in this broad field, many developing countries in Asia and the Pacific lack a comprehensive understanding of the rapidly changing needs of the business sectora result of the ongoing globalization of productionand how such needs should be taken into account in the design and implementation of effective enabling policy frameworks for SME development.",F

The book includes six chapters, each followed by commentaries, grouped in the following six parts: Multilateral governance of global trade; regionalism and Multilateralism; Services liberalization as a development opportunity; Trade liberalization and poverty reduction; Taming non-tariff barriers and determining the border for trade policymaking.

"Andrea Spear|Mia Mikic","Delivering in Nairobi  and After","Much hinges on the outcome of the World Trade Organization's Tenth Ministerial Conference in Nairobi in mid-December. The World Trade Organization (WTO) is marking the 20th anniversary of its establishment during the Uruguay Round, almost half a century after 23 countries set up its predecessor for trade in goods, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Yet the mood is far from celebratory. The downbeat feeling is more related to the question of the WTO's relevance, now and in future. The WTO was established in 1995 by 123 countries to seek freer and fairer trade by performing three main functions: 1) to serve as a permanent platform for negotiating on rules and market access issues; 2) to monitor implementation of the WTO Agreements, the legal ground-rules for international trade; and 3) to assist members to resolve disputes under the Dispute Settlement Mechanism. Its inability to shake off the shadow of the widely perceived 'failure' of the Doha Round (launched in November 2001) explains this sense of impotence and tests the 162 members' resolve to make the WTO work for all.",F

"Yann Duval|Tengfei Wang|Dimitra Malakoudi|Pamela Bayona","Trade Facilitation Implementation in Asia-Pacific 2015: Moving Towards Paperless Trade","This issue of the Trade Insights series provides analysis of the recently released United Nations Regional Commissions (UNRC) Global Trade Facilitation (TF) and Paperless Trade Implementation Survey 2015 for 44 economies and 5 sub-regions across the Asia-Pacific. The survey provides data on the implementation of 38 TF measures, including but not limited to those featured in the WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement (WTO TFA). The analysis of the implementation data collected reveals that the level of implementation of the ambitious set of TF measures considered in the UNRC Survey reaches almost 50%, indicating that the region has been actively engaged in implementing TF initiatives. However, implementation of TF remains very heterogeneous across the Asia-Pacific region, with Australia, Republic of Korea and Singapore achieving scores in excess of 85%, while other economies barely achieve 15% implementation. Whilst more than half of all 44 Asia-Pacific economies have at least partially implemented 80% of TFA-related measures included in the Survey, there is significant room for progress to further facilitate trade and reduce trade costs.",F

It concludes that the existing frameworks are very inadequate: in almost all the multilateral and preferential agreements focusing predominantly on trade (GATS Mode 4 and Preferential Trade Agreement), countries have made binding commitments only with respect to the temporary entry of high-skilled service providers.",F
"Yann Duval|Chorthip Utoktham","Trade Costs in Asia and the Pacific: Improved and Sectoral Estimates","There is ample evidence that successful implementation of bilateral or regional trade and economic integration initiatives would have a very significant impact on intraregional trade in Asia and the Pacific.  However, little is known about the level of intraregional trade costs in the region and to what extent these costs may have decreased over time.  This paper introduces new aggregate and sectoral estimates of bilateral trade costs in Asia and the Pacific available in an updated and extended version of the ESCAP Trade Cost Database (Version 2). The new data suggests that (1) most countries and subregions have made improvements in reducing trade costs; (2) Trade costs among Asian countries still often exceed the costs of trade of Asian countries with developed countries outside the region; and (3) tariff costs accounts for only a small portion of comprehensive trade costs  although tariff cuts account for a large share of overall trade cost reduction over the past decade.  At the sectoral level, agricultural trade costs are systematically found to exceed manufacturing trade costs, even when tariff costs are excluded. The fact that agricultural trade costs in many developing  countries are twice as high as their trade costs in manufactured goods suggest that focusing trade facilitation efforts on that sector may be particularly productive, especially given the importance of this sector for poverty reduction and more inclusive and sustainable development.",F

Results of the non-tariff policy-related trade costs modeling exercise strongly suggest that improving port efficiency (liner shipping connectivity) and access to information and communication technology facilities is essential to reducing trade costs.",F

A model of comprehensive trade costs is then developed and estimated using these specific indicators in an effort to identify policies and measures that have a significant effect on trade costs, and to prioritize them.  The trade costs between India and Mekong countries are found to be high: from 20% to 100% higher than those prevailing among Mekong countries.  However, the fact that India, China, Thailand, and most of the other India-Mekong countries made more progress in reducing trade costs with each other than with developed countries - such as Japan and the USA - is encouraging, showing signs of slow but steady improvements in regional connectivity.  Econometric results suggest that countries should prioritize policies aimed at further developing maritime and ICT services to reduce trade costs.",F

It concludes that the existing frameworks are very inadequate: in almost all the multilateral and preferential agreements focusing predominantly on trade (GATS Mode 4 and Preferential Trade Agreement), countries have made binding commitments only with respect to the temporary entry of high-skilled service providers.",F
"Yann Duval|Chorthip Utoktham","Trade Costs in Asia and the Pacific: Improved and Sectoral Estimates","There is ample evidence that successful implementation of bilateral or regional trade and economic integration initiatives would have a very significant impact on intraregional trade in Asia and the Pacific.  However, little is known about the level of intraregional trade costs in the region and to what extent these costs may have decreased over time.  This paper introduces new aggregate and sectoral estimates of bilateral trade costs in Asia and the Pacific available in an updated and extended version of the ESCAP Trade Cost Database (Version 2). The new data suggests that (1) most countries and subregions have made improvements in reducing trade costs; (2) Trade costs among Asian countries still often exceed the costs of trade of Asian countries with developed countries outside the region; and (3) tariff costs accounts for only a small portion of comprehensive trade costs  although tariff cuts account for a large share of overall trade cost reduction over the past decade.  At the sectoral level, agricultural trade costs are systematically found to exceed manufacturing trade costs, even when tariff costs are excluded. The fact that agricultural trade costs in many developing  countries are twice as high as their trade costs in manufactured goods suggest that focusing trade facilitation efforts on that sector may be particularly productive, especially given the importance of this sector for poverty reduction and more inclusive and sustainable development.",F

A model of comprehensive trade costs is then developed and estimated using these specific indicators in an effort to identify policies and measures that have a significant effect on trade costs, and to prioritize them.  The trade costs between India and Mekong countries are found to be high: from 20% to 100% higher than those prevailing among Mekong countries.  However, the fact that India, China, Thailand, and most of the other India-Mekong countries made more progress in reducing trade costs with each other than with developed countries - such as Japan and the USA - is encouraging, showing signs of slow but steady improvements in regional connectivity.  Econometric results suggest that countries should prioritize policies aimed at further developing maritime and ICT services to reduce trade costs.",F

It concludes that the existing frameworks are very inadequate: in almost all the multilateral and preferential agreements focusing predominantly on trade (GATS Mode 4 and Preferential Trade Agreement), countries have made binding commitments only with respect to the temporary entry of high-skilled service providers.",F
"Yann Duval|Chorthip Utoktham","Trade Costs in Asia and the Pacific: Improved and Sectoral Estimates","There is ample evidence that successful implementation of bilateral or regional trade and economic integration initiatives would have a very significant impact on intraregional trade in Asia and the Pacific.  However, little is known about the level of intraregional trade costs in the region and to what extent these costs may have decreased over time.  This paper introduces new aggregate and sectoral estimates of bilateral trade costs in Asia and the Pacific available in an updated and extended version of the ESCAP Trade Cost Database (Version 2). The new data suggests that (1) most countries and subregions have made improvements in reducing trade costs; (2) Trade costs among Asian countries still often exceed the costs of trade of Asian countries with developed countries outside the region; and (3) tariff costs accounts for only a small portion of comprehensive trade costs  although tariff cuts account for a large share of overall trade cost reduction over the past decade.  At the sectoral level, agricultural trade costs are systematically found to exceed manufacturing trade costs, even when tariff costs are excluded. The fact that agricultural trade costs in many developing  countries are twice as high as their trade costs in manufactured goods suggest that focusing trade facilitation efforts on that sector may be particularly productive, especially given the importance of this sector for poverty reduction and more inclusive and sustainable development.",F

Results of the non-tariff policy-related trade costs modeling exercise strongly suggest that improving port efficiency (liner shipping connectivity) and access to information and communication technology facilities is essential to reducing trade costs.",F
"Yann Duval|Chorthip Utoktham","Trade costs in the India-Mekong Subregion: Identifying Policy Priorities for Trade Facilitation","This paper explores the trade facilitation performance of India and Mekong countries using a new measure of bilateral comprehensive trade costs, complemented by a review of specific trade policy and trade facilitation-related indicators.  A model of comprehensive trade costs is then developed and estimated using these specific indicators in an effort to identify policies and measures that have a significant effect on trade costs, and to prioritize them.  The trade costs between India and Mekong countries are found to be high: from 20% to 100% higher than those prevailing among Mekong countries.  However, the fact that India, China, Thailand, and most of the other India-Mekong countries made more progress in reducing trade costs with each other than with developed countries - such as Japan and the USA - is encouraging, showing signs of slow but steady improvements in regional connectivity.  Econometric results suggest that countries should prioritize policies aimed at further developing maritime and ICT services to reduce trade costs.",F

Only limited empirical knowledge is available on the determinants of these expenditures. OBJECTIVES: In this paper we analyze which characteristics of private households influence out-of-pocket pharmaceutical expenditure (OOPPE) in Austria.  DESIGN & METHODS: We use cross-sectional information on OOPPE and on household characteristics provided by the Austrian household budget survey 2009/10. We split pharmaceutical expenditures into the two components prescription fees and over-the-counter (OTC) expenditures. To adjust for the specific characteristics of the data we compare different econometric approaches: two-part model, hurdle model, generalized linear model, zero-inflated negative binomial regression model. FINDINGS: The finally selected econometric approaches give a quite consistent picture. The probability of expenditures of both types is strongly influenced by the household structure. It increases",I
"Alice Sanwald|Engelbert Theurl","Out-of-pocket expenditures of private households for dental services - Empirical evidence from Austria","Background: Dental services differ from other health services in several dimensions. One important difference is that a substantial share of costs of dental services ? especially those beyond routine dental treatment - are paid directly by the patient out-of-pocket. Objectives: We analyze the socio-economic determinants of out-of-pocket expenditures for dentals services (OOPE) in Austria on the household level. Methods: We use cross-sectional information on OOPE and on household characteristics provided by the Austrian household budget survey 2009/10. We apply a two-part model (Logit/GLM) and a one-part GLM. Results: The probability of OOPE is strongly affected by the life cycle (structure) of the household. It increases with adults? age, with income and partially with the level of education. The type of public insurance has an influence on the expenditure probability while the existence of private health insurance has no significant effect. In contrast to the highly statistically significant coefficients in the first stage the covariates of the second stage remain predominantly insignificant. According to our results, the level of expenditures is mainly driven by the level of education and income. The results of the one-part GLM confirm the results of the two-part model. Conclusions: Our results allow new insights into the determinants of OOPE for dental care. The household level turns out to be an adequate basis to study the determinants of OOPE, although we should be cautious to jump to conclusions for the individual level.",I
"Elisabeth Christen|Joseph Francois|Bernard Hoekman","CGE modeling of market access in services","This paper examines how the applied multi-sector computable general equilibrium (CGE) literature has moved into quantification of the impacts of greater market access for services. This includes discussion of multisector linkages to the service sector, as well both measuring barriers to trade and investment (generally with a mix of firm surveys, price comparisons, and econometrics), and how changes in these barriers, however measured, have been implemented in the CGE literature. Three challenges are highlighted. The first is identification of how trade in services takes place and how market access is therefore affected by policy. A challenge is to find data sufficiently robust for modeling purposes. A third, linked to the data problem, is to quantify the barriers to be examined. Significant progress has been made in modeling FDI and linking this to productivity, which turns out to be important. The paper also provides an example of modeling productivity linkages to openness and domestic regulation, with an applied CGE model of Italy. This illustrates cross-sector linkages and the integration of economic data and policy measures to define service sector experiments. Priorities for future research include better modeling of market structure, the linkages between sectors and the complementarities between different modes of supplying services.",F

We show that when heterogeneously informed traders have inaccurate information, an exchange rate is likely to be misaligned from its fundamental value in the presence of noise trades. Then the central bank uses the disclosure of public information to improve the accuracy of private agentsf information and encourage risk-arbitrage thereby enhancing the informativeness of the exchange rate. This effect holds, even when the central bank does not possess superior information to traders, as long as public information is not perfectly correlated with the information of traders. We provide evidence that announced interventions are more effective in periods of high implied volatility, consistent with the theoretical prediction that the implied volatility of the exchange rate is positively correlated with the information inaccuracy of traders and the degree of an exchange rate misalignment.",F

Instead, order flows of financial and corporate customers reflect in real time the evolution of macroeconomies.

Among the results, we first find that the daily exchange rate has a cointegrating relationship with the cumula-tive price change of the segment for which the London and New York markets are both open, but not with that of any other segments. Second, the cumulative price change of the London/N.Y. segment is the most persistent among the five market segments in the medium- and long-run. These results suggest that the greatest concentration of informed traders is in the London/N.Y. segment where intraday transactions are the highest. This is consistent with the theoretical prediction by Admati and Pfleiderer (1988) that prices are more informative when trading volume is heavier.",F
"Peir-Shyan Liaw|Ming-Fang Cheng","Supply Shocks, Price Regime Collapse under Dual Floating Exchange Rate Regimes","This paper extends the theoretical model of Liaw et al. (2004) to incorporate the supply shocks of output. For a country adopting dual floating exchange rate system and facing the supply shocks will cause the price level to increase persistently. If the price level reaches the price ceiling threshold, then the monetary authority will adopt deflationary policy. It is wondered how these shocks will affect the possible adjustment paths of relevant macroeconomic variables. The major findings are as follows. The liquidity effect, foreign interest revenue effect and interest rate income effect which are all caused by change in the nominal money supply are the key factors affecting the possible adjustment paths of relevant macroeconomic variables. Moreover, whether the price regime will collapse or not and the timing of the monetary authority will adjust nominal money supply are dependent on the price ceiling threshold. The stronger the desire of the monetary authority to defend the price ceiling threshold, the earlier the monetary authority will adopt the monetary policy to attack inflation.",F

"Su-Hua Wang|Che-Hung Lin","Applying AHP to Web Navigation Design","Due to increasing popularity of the World Wide Web, web-based systems are widely used. Most corporate web sites try to enhance their usability by providing artistic web presentations. However, the design of web sites is not judged solely on an artistic basis. Two of the most important design criteria for web sites are access to web content and navigation architecture. This research proposes a platform for automatically evaluating the quality of web navigation architecture. Because of the hierarchical characteristics of web navigation design factors, the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method is applied in the evaluation process. This paper describes both the application of the AHP method and the framework of the evaluation platform. Navigation strategies and navigation criteria are defined as the decision factors. Various navigation architectures are natural alternatives of the web architecture design. To provide an evaluation environment for web designs and SQA members, the AHP method is implemented in the evaluation platform to analyze the requirements conformance of web navigation architectures.",M

In analyzing the credibility of the Venezuela crawling band, first we use the so-called simple credibility tests developed by Svensson (1991). Additionally, we estimate the expected rate of realignment using the drift- adjustment method. Both the credibility tests and the drift-adjustment method give similar results, showing that the crawling-band system was highly credible during the period.",F

"Ignacio Velez-Pareja","Proper Determination of the Growth Rate for Growing Perpetuities: The Growth Rate for the Terminal Value","In this paper we find restrictions for the value of a parameter used in defining the cost of capital for perpetuities and terminal values: the growth rate for the free cash flow. When defining the growth rate for the free cash flow the usual warning is to set it below the growth of the economy or the industry because in the long run the firm would be larger than the economy or the industry. This approach might be considered somewhat standard in the sense that usually they either take the growth of NOPLAT (mathematically) and/or check that it complies with the previous statement. However, in this paper we propose to find another objective limits deriving them from the formulation for the cost of capital in perpetuity and the traditional formula for the terminal value in a world where the discount rate for the tax savings is Kd, the cost of debt. These limits give additional criteria for determining the value of g. The limits are calculated in terms of real rate of growth. We use an example to show the effects of violating these limits. Calculating these limits is very important in valuation because usually the terminal value is a substantial portion of the levered value of the firm.",M
"Ignacio Vélez-Pareja|Antonio Burbano","Consistency in Valuation: A Practical Guide","Abstract: Practitioners and teachers very easily break some consistency rules when doing or teaching valuation of assets. In this short and simple note we present a practical guide to call the attention upon the most frequent broken consistency rules. They have to do firstly with the consistency in the matching of the cash flows, this is, the free cash flow (FCF), the cash flow to debt (CFD), the cash flow to equity (CFE), the capital cash flow (CCF) and the tax savings or tax shield (TS). Secondly, they have to do with the proper expression for the cost of levered equity, Ke and different formulations for the weighted average cost of capital, WACC, with finite cash flows and perpetuities. Thirdly, they have to do with the consistency between the terminal value and growth for the FCF and the terminal value and growth for the CFE. And finally, the proper determination of the cost of capital either departing from the cost of unlevered equity (Ku) or the cost of levered equity (Ke). We illustrate the consistency using a simple example. In the Appendixes we show some algebraic derivations.",M
"Ignacio Velez-Pareja|Joseph Tham","Do the RIM (Residual Income Model), EVA® and DCF (Discounted Cash Flow) Really Match?","In Velez-Pareja and Tham (2001), we presented several different ways to value cash flows. First, we apply the standard after-tax Weighted Average Cost of Capital, WACC to the free cash flow (FCF). Second, we apply the adjusted WACC to the FCF, and third we apply the WACC to the capital cash flow. In addition, we discount the cash flow to equity (CFE) with the appropriate returns to levered equity. We refer to these four ways as the discounted cash flow (DCF) methods. In recent years, two new approaches, the Residual Income Method (RIM) and the Economic Value Added (EVA) have become very popular. Supporters claim the RIM and EVA are superior to the DCF methods. It may be case that the RIM and EVA approaches are useful tools for assessing managerial performance and providing proper incentives. However, from a valuation point of view, the RIM and EVA are problematic because they use book values from the balance sheet. It is easy to show that under certain conditions, the results from the RIM and EVA exactly match the results from the DCF methods. Velez-Pareja 1999 reported that when using relatively complex examples and book values to calculate Economic Value Added (EVA), the results were inconsistent with Net Present Value (NPV). Tham 2001, reported consistency between the Residual Income Model (RIM) and the Discounted Cash Flow model (DCF) with a very simple example. Fernandez 2002 shows examples where there is consistency between DCF, RIM and EVA. He uses a constant value for the cost of levered equity capital and in another example constant debt. Young and O'Byrne, 2001, show simple examples for EVA but do not show the equivalence between DCF and EVA. Ehrbar (1998) uses a very simple example with perpetuities and shows the equivalence between EVA and DCF. Lundholm and O'Keefe, 2001, show this equivalence with an example with constant Ke. Tham 2001, commented on their paper. Stewart, 1999, shows the equivalence between DCF and EVA with an example using a constant discount rate. Copeland, et al, show an example with constant WACC and constant cost of equity even with varying debt and assuming a target leverage that is different to the actual leverage. In general, textbooks do not specify clearly how EVA should be used to give consistent results. In this teaching note using a complex example with varying debt, varying leverage and terminal (or continuing value), we show the consistency between DCF, RIM and EVA. We stress what Velez-Pareja 1999 and Fernandez 2002 said: for a single period, RI or EVA does not measure value. We have to include expectations and market values in the calculation of discount rates and hence values.",M
"Ignacio Velez-Pareja","Once More, the Correct Definition for the Cash Flows to Value a Firm. (Free Cash Flow and Cash Flow to Equity)","This paper is an extension of a previous one untitled The Correct Definition for the Cash Flows to Value a Firm (Free Cash Flow and Cash Flow to Equity) . We have added a comparative analysis between the current practice of including as cash flows amounts that belong to the Balance Sheet and the proposed approach to include only as cash flows those elements that in fact are cash flows and hence are not listed in the Balance Sheet. Differences are significant. Surprisingly there is a wide range of interpretations on how to calculate the cash flows for valuation purposes. This ample definition of what the cash flows are is shared by academicians and practitioners. Some of the definitions openly contradict the essential and basic concepts of cash flow and time value of money. In this note we specify very clearly what has to be included in those cash flows and the reasons why they should be included. The main issue is related to the inclusion or exclusion of some items in the working capital and the current practice to consider that funds that appear in the Balance Sheet (cash and market securities and the like) belong to the free cash flow FCF and the cash flow to equity CFE. In the same line of reasoning, the idea is that cash flows have to be consistent with financial statements. With a hypothetical example we show the implicit financial facts reflected in the financial statements behind the practice of including as cash flow items that appear in the Balance Sheet.",M

First, a conceptual framework regarding Net Present Value, NPV, is presented. Second, the note presents an approach for calculating the free cash flow of a project starting from the periodic net cash flows. Third, a procedure for calculating the real free cash flow is developed. Fourth, the EVA is presented and contrasted to NPV. EVA starts from accounting figures (profit) and NPV starts from net cash flows. The coincidence between MVA and NPV is examined. Four examples are presented which reveal some inconsistencies between the two measurement. The four examples show circumstances where EVA underestimates the value generated by a project or firm as compared with the NPV. An approach for calculating the real EVA is presented. The note offers reflections upon figures that should be employed in order to calculate the cost of the invested capital or equity to be included in EVA calculation. Finally, different approaches to calculate EVA and MVA are compared with NPV results.",M

"Alejandro Ome V.","The Effects of Meritocracy for Teachers in Colombia","Executive Summary. In 2002 the Colombian government issued the  Estatuto de Profesionalización Docente (henceforth EPD), introducing a new code for public school teachers.  The EPD implements two main strategies in order to improve the quality of education; first, attract capable individuals to the teaching profession; and second, implement recurring evaluations so teachers that are not meeting the expectations are let go and accomplished teachers are promoted. In this report I ask three main questions:&#61623; Has the EPD succeeded in attracting qualified individuals to the teaching profession?&#61623; Has the EPD improved students´ outcomes?&#61623; Is the new system to grant promotions awarding the best teachers?To tackle  these issues I exploit the fact that when the reform was issued, incumbent teachers were allowed to remain under the old regime. This old regime provides much more labor stability, and its promotion policy is based on a fixed schedule. The gradualism of EPD´s implementation causes that even by 2009 we observe both  EPD and non-EPD teachers in schools, allowing comparisons between these two types of teachers over different outcomes of interest.",I

"Jaime Rafael Ahcar Olmos","Comprendiendo la Globalización","RESUMEN Debido al uso indiscriminado que se hace del concepto globalizaci&oacute;n, es pertinente que nos cercioremos de entenderlo correctamente. Si entendemos la globalizaci&oacute;n como un fen&oacute;meno complejo, reversible, que no es nuevo, ni homog&eacute;neo y que consiste en el incremento de las m&uacute;ltiples redes de  interdependencia a distancias supracontinentales, en sus diversas dimensiones, gracias al aumento de la rapidez y a la reducci&oacute;n de los costos de transporte y de las comunicaciones, y a los procesos de liberalizaci&oacute;n y apertura, podremos alcanzar una mejor comprensi&oacute;n de c&oacute;mo la globalizaci&oacute;n transforma nuestras sociedades. En s&iacute; misma la globalizaci&oacute;n no podr&aacute; mejorar o empeorar el mundo en el que vivimos. Los efectos del proceso de globalizaci&oacute;n estar&aacute;n asociados a las decisiones pol&iacute;ticas, de producci&oacute;n y consumo que tomen los agentes generadores de la globalizaci&oacute;n que se encuentran en la parte alta de la pir&aacute;mide de influencia, encabezada por los gobiernos de los pa&iacute;ses m&aacute;s poderosos, las firmas multinacionales y los organismos multilaterales. Los movimientos alterglobalizaci&oacute;n, la comunidad acad&eacute;mica y estudiantil y los ciudadanos del com&uacute;n pueden contribuir a la construcci&oacute;n de una globalizaci&oacute;n alternativa que contribuya a garantizar el desarrollo sostenible y la reducci&oacute;n de las desigualdades a escala global.  ABSTRACT Due to the indiscriminate use that is done of the concept of globalization, there becomes pertinent that we make sure of understanding it correctly. If we deal to globalization as a complex, reversible phenomenon, which is neither new, nor homogeneous and that implies the increase of the multiple nets of interdependence to supra-continental distances in its different dimensions thanks to the increase of the rapidity and the reduction of the costs of transport and communications, and to the processes of liberalization and opening, we will be able to reach a better comprehension of how the globalization transforms our societies. It is not globalization itself that will be able to improve or to worsen the world in which we live. The effects of the process of globalization will be associated with the political, production and consumption decisions that there take the generating agents of the globalization who are in the high part of the pyramid of influence, headed by the governments of the most powerful countries, the multinationals corporations and the multilateral organizations. The alterglobalization movements, the academic and student community and the ordinary citizens can contribute to the construction of an alternative globalization that helps to guarantee the sustainable development and the reduction of worldwide inequities.",F

Primero se determinaron las probabilidades que tienen los hijos de superar la educación de sus padres, a partir del nivel educativo alcanzado por ellos. Segundo se construyeron matrices de transición por medio de un modelo probit ordenado con un nivel de confianza del 95%. Una vez establecida esta matriz se empleó la metodología de Shorrocks para calcular el índice de movilidad social intergeneracional educativa. Finalmente, para correlacionar los niveles educacionales con la ocupación tanto de padres como de hijos, se utilizó la metodología de análisis multivariado con graficas de asociación. Los resultados muestran que en esta comunidad existe una alta movilidad social educativa (0,7675), como la movilidad se presenta en los niveles más bajos de educación, esto no significa que las posibilidades de los hijos de salir de la pobreza sean altas. Se encontró que existe una correlación entre los niveles educativos más bajos con ocupaciones poco productivas, lo que permite concluir que la comunidad de Ranchos del Inat se encuentra inmersa en la trampa de la pobreza.",I

La necesidad de llenar este vacío historiográfico ha sido una de las principales motivaciones en este trabajo, pues el estudio del tranvía de Medellín ofrece la oportunidad de entender, desde una nueva perspectiva, cómo la ciudad se trasformó definitivamente a medida que se consolidaba su proceso industrial y acogía a una cada vez mayor población obrera.",R
"Jorge Lotero Contreras","Las relaciones del desarrollo económico con la geografía y el territorio: una revisión","La geografía y el desarrollo económico pueden catalogarse como dos de los campos de la disciplina económica de mayor transformación conceptual. Esto se ha debido a los avances en teoría proporcionados por la revolución de los rendimientos crecientes, el neoinstitucionalismo y los nuevos fallos de mercado y de coordinación. De estas transformaciones no ha escapado la conceptualización del desarrollo regional como un área intermedia entre la geografía y el desarrollo económico. El fracaso de las teorías que les servían de fundamento a las políticas centralizadas de desarrollo así como éxito alcanzado por regiones no metropolitanas en el contexto internacional, han obligado a la ciencia regional a hacer importantes replanteamientos sobre las trayectorias del desarrollo en relación con su organización socioeconómica en el espacio, dando lugar a la adopción de nuevas categorías para la economía como la de territorio. Este trabajo es una aproximación a la relación entre el pensamiento sobre el desarrollo y su evolución en relación con la geografía y la noción de territorio",R

"Ernesto Lopez-Cordova|Alejandro Micco|Danielken Molina","How Sensitive Are Latin American Exports to Chinese Competition in the U.S. Market?","This paper estimates the elasticity of substitution of U.S. imports using detailed trade data over the 1990-2003 period. The authors use a two-stage least squares framework in order to identify the elasticity parameter of interest. The authors use the elasticity estimates to assess the extent to which Latin American and Chinese goods compete in the U.S. market by providing forecasts of how alternative policy scenarios may affect exports to the United States. The analysis considers the following scenarios: (i) currency revaluation in China; (ii) elimination of U.S. tariffs on Latin American exports under a hemispheric free trade agreement; and (iii) the elimination of quotas on apparel and textile exports under the Multi-Fiber Agreement. The findings show that a 20-percent appreciation of the renminbi reduces Chinese exports to the United States by a fifth, although since other regions increase sales to that market (0.5 percent for Latin America), U.S. imports decline by only 1.7 percent. Hemispheric free trade would increase Latin America's exports to the United States by around 3 percent. The removal of the quotas would lead to a sharp increase in Chinese sales to the United States (40 percent), but Latin America would see its share of the U.S. market decline by around 2 percent (2.5 percentage points). China's gains would come mainly at the expense of other regions of the world.",F

It argues, with the help of descriptive statistics, an empirical growth model and a gravity model, that the traditional, trade related gains from regional integration have been and are bound to be limited because of (1) the countries´ high openness; (2) the limited size of the common, enlarged market; and (3) the countries´ relatively similar factor endowments.

"Jeffrey Frankel","A Comparison Of Product Price Targeting And Other Monetary Anchor Options,  For Commodity Exporters In Latin America","Seven possible nominal variables are considered as candidates to be the anchor or target for monetary policy.  The context is countries in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC), which tend to be price takers on world markets, to produce commodity exports subject to volatile terms of trade, and to experience procyclical international finance.  Three anchor candidates are exchange rate pegs:  to the dollar, euro and SDR. One candidate is orthodox Inflation Targeting.  Three candidates represent proposals for a new sort of inflation targeting that differs from the usual focus on the CPI, in that prices of export commodities are given substantial weight and prices of imports are not:  PEP (Peg the Export Price), PEPI (Peg an Export Price Index), and PPT  (Product Price Targeting).  The selling point of these production-based price indices is that each could serve as a nominal anchor while yet accommodating terms of trade shocks, in comparison to a CPI target.  CPI-targeters such as Brazil, Chile, and Peru are observed to respond to increases in world prices of imported oil with monetary policy that is sufficiently tight to appreciate their currencies, an undesirable property, which is the opposite of accommodating the terms of trade.  As hypothesized, a product price target generally does a better job of stabilizing the real domestic prices of tradable goods than does a CPI target.  Bottom line: A Product Price Targeter would appreciate in response to an increase in world prices of its commodity exports, not in response to an increase in world prices of its imports.  CPI targeting gets this backwards.",F

The results show that OBMEP has a positive and statistically significant impact on school performance in Mathematics among nineth-graders. This impact increases for schools that participate in repeated editions of OBMEPs and is larger in higher test score percentiles.

"Ana MaríaDíaz|FabioSánchez","A GEOGRAPHY OF ILLICIT CROPS (COCA LEAF) AND ARMED CONFLICT IN COLOMBIA","Colombia is currently the world´s largest producer of coca leaf and the principal producer of opium poppies in the Americas; the plants are the basic raw materials used to produce cocaine and heroin. This document will analyse the current relationship between these crops and illegal armed groups in Colombia, using the hypothesis that the geographical intensification of the conflict is the principal cause of expanding illicit crop production. This relationship was analysed using a theoretic model, in which an interaction between illegal armed activity and strategic territorial control lead to cocaine production. Spatial analysis techniques were then applied, especially spatial association indicators; and a clear spatial dynamic was observed, related to the two aspects mentioned above. Non parametric exercises were also carried out using matching estimators, to determine the effect illegal armed groups have on coca crops, and also to analyse the efficiency of aerial eradication policies. The results suggest that a large percentage of coca production in Colombia is due to the effects of illegal armed activity. We therefore conclude that the expansion of illegal crop growing is a consequence of the expanding conflict. In contrast, coca crops can only be used to explain a small part of the armed conflict in Colombia. In addition, we found that crop eradication via aerial spraying has not been an efficient tool in the fight against coca production in the country.",R

"Fabio Sánchez|Mario Chacón","CONFLICTO, ESTADO Y DESCENTRALIZACIÓN: DEL PROGRESO SOCIAL A LA DISPUTA ARMADA POR ELCONTROL LOCAL, 1974-2002","El objetivo de este trabajo es determinar las variables que explican la actividad armada de los grupos irregulares desde mediados de los años setenta y establecer las posibles causas de expansión hasta el año 2002, teniendo en cuenta particularmente el papel de la descentralización entendida coma la mayor autonomía política, presupuestal y administrativa de los gobiernos locales. En los últimos treinta años el país experimentó profundos cambios a nivel económico, social e institucional. No solo se consolidó el proceso de urbanización a la vez que disminuyó la participación del sector agropecuario en la producción nacional sino que se profundizó fuertemente el proceso de descentralización desde mediados de los años ochenta. El presente trabajo sostiene que la descentralización trasladó el conflicto a una disputa por el poder local, lo que se manifiesta en el uso de la violencia ya sea para apropiarse de los bienes y recursos públicos, para influenciar los resultados políticos y electorales de conveniencia para los grupos irregulares y/o para consolidar su dominio territorial desde lo local. El análisis de la actividad temprana (1974-1982) de los grupos guerrilleros muestra que ella está explicada en mayor medida por variables socioeconómicas (pobreza, desigualdad). Sin embargo, su evolución desde mediados de los ochenta está ligada al proceso de descentralización el cual creó incentivos a los grupos irregulares para el dominio de lo local a través del uso de la violencia. Dada la debilidad del Estado en lo relativo al monopolio de la fuerza y a la administración de justicia, se facilitó la expansión e intensificación de la actividad armada de los grupos guerrilleros y de las autodefensas ilegales. Los distintos resultados estadísticos y econométricos revelan un nexo fuerte entre la intensificación de la acción armada y la mayor independencia política y fortaleza fiscal de los gobiernos locales. Esto trabajo contó con nuevos datos históricos sobre el conflicto e información económica, fiscal, social y política a nivel municipal. Se utilizó la información recientemente recopilada a nivel municipal por el IEPRI sobre la actividad y acciones de armadas de los distintos grupos guerrilleros (FARC, ELN. M-19) para el período 1974-1982 y las bases de datos municipales de la Fundación Social, Departamento Nacional de Planeación y Presidencia de la República sobre acciones y ataques de grupos guerrilleros, de autodefensas y de delincuentes para el período 1985 a 2002.",R

Posteriormente, se analiza dinámica existente entre conflicto y crimen violento usando técnicas de análisis espacial. Finalmente se investiga los determinantes del crimen violento (homicidios, secuestros, delitos contra el patrimonio y la piratería) con las herramientas de la econometría espacial. Los resultados sugieren que en todos los delitos se presenta persistencia y difusión espacial La eficiencia de la justicia, el narcotráfico y, en gran medida, la actividad de los grupos armados ilegales son las variables que explican en mayor medida la violencia. Adicionalmente, el secuestro está fundamentalmente explicado por la actividad de dichos grupos.

Se inició el proceso de apertura comercial que estuvo acompañado de la liberalización de las importaciones y la implementación de nuevas estrategias de promoción a las exportaciones. Adicionalmente, se liberalizó la cuenta de capitales aunque manteniendo algunas restricciones sobre los flujos financieros de corto plazo para evitar la volatilidad asociada a los mismos. Las exportaciones, que fueron el motor de crecimiento durante los ochenta, dejaron de serlo desde inicios de los noventa. De hecho, con la entrada masiva de capitales y la consecuente apreciación de la tasa de cambio y el crecimiento de la demanda agregada, se generó una expansión de los no transables. A finales de los noventa se presentó un deterioro de la economía en general y de los indicadores sociales en particular. El propósito de este trabajo es analizar el impacto de la liberalización comercial y la promoción de las exportaciones sobre el empleo, la desigualdad y la pobreza. Para tal propósito se utilizaron las metodologías de descomposición de la balanza de pagos y el crecimiento económico planteado por Morley y Vos.

La evolución de la Violencia nos plantea diversas preguntas ya que su aparición e intensidad es diferente para cada región del país, indicando que ésta no siguió un patrón uniforme. Este trabajo busca encontrar las características municipales que determinaron la presencia e intensidad de la violencia, durante los periodos de Violencia temprana (1946-1950) y de Violencia tardía (1958-1963). Para este objetivo, se utilizaron técnicas de econometría espacial. La evidencia sugiere que en ambos periodos, la violencia presenta difusión espacial y persistencia en el tiempo. Las variables políticas incluidas en el modelo, nos sugieren una lógica de la violencia, en la cual ésta se usa como herramienta de intimidación, principalmente en municipios con polarización política. Los resultados muestran cómo factores locales, previos a la Violencia, ya sean económicos, geográficos, espaciales, o políticos, influenciaron la violencia y su intensidad durante el periodo.",R
"Felipe Barrera|Ana María Ibáñez","DOES VIOLENCE REDUCE INVESTMENT IN EDUCATION?: A THEORETICAL AND EMPIRICAL APPROACH","The paper develops a dynamic theoretical model and presents empirical evidence about the relationship between violence and education investments. Although some papers have estimated regressions to link educational outcomes and violence, no formal models have been developed yet. A theoretical model is crucial to understand the different channels through which violence affects education. Three channels are identified. First, violence can affect directly the utility of households and, therefore, it may modify the consumption of education. Second, extreme violence can destroy physical capital and create uncertainty, which will lower investment and production. In the long run, destruction of physical assets and drop in investment impact the income of households who in turn must reduce consumption and cutback investments in education. Third, violence can modify the rates of return of education, and therefore, can change the investment on education. We find violence indeed exerts a toll on education. School enrollment is less in Colombian municipalities with homicide rates above the national median. Moreover, the likelihood of school enrollment decreases as homicide rates rise for all group ages. The impact of homicide rates is larger than transferences from the national government to the local government earmarked for investment in education and health.",I

"Ana María Díaz|Fabio Sánchez","GEOGRAFÍA DE LOS CULTIVOS ILÍCITOS Y CONFLICTO ARMADO EN COLOMBIA","Colombia es actualmente el mayor productor de hoja de coca del mundo y de amapola de América, insumos básicos para la producción de cocaína y heroína. Este documento analiza la relación existente entre estos cultivos y los grupos armados ilegales en Colombia, bajo la hipótesis que la intensificación geográfica del conflicto es la causa principal de la expansión de los cultivos ilícitos. Para analizar esta relación se desarrolla un modelo teórico en el que la producción de coca es el resultado de la interacción de la actividad armada ilegal y el control territorial como estrategia de los grupos ilegales. Posteriormente se hace uso de las técnicas de análisis espacial, en particular los indicadores de asociación espacial, en los cuales se observa una clara dinámica espacial entre los dos fenómenos. De igual forma, se realizan ejercicios no paramétricos, con las técnicas de emparejamiento o matching estimators, con cuales se busca encontrar el efecto de la actividad de los grupos armados ilegales sobre los cultivos de coca, y por otra parte, se busca analizar la eficiencia de las políticas de la erradicación por aspersión. Los resultados sugieren que el efecto de la actividad armada ilegal en Colombia explica en un gran porcentaje la producción de hoja de coca en el país, por lo tanto se concluye que la expansión de los cultivos es una consecuencia de la expansión del conflicto. En contraste, los cultivos de coca explican solo una pequeña proporción del conflicto armado. Por otra parte, los ejercicios sobre la erradicación por aspersión exponen que esta no ha sido una herramienta eficiente para la lucha contra la producción de coca en el territorio nacional.",R

La legislación colombiana para la población desplazada ha generado responsabilidades diferenciadas entre los gobiernos nacionales y locales. La responsabilidad administrativa, y no necesariamente financiera, de provisión de atención a la población desplazada recae sobre los municipios quienes enfrentan un reto importante debido su carácter multisectorial. Nuestros resultados muestran que la distribución geográfica de la población desplazada no refleja la presión de la demanda por atención en cada municipio colombiano. Aunque las grandes ciudades absorben los mayores flujos de desplazados, la evidencia sugiere que las ciudades intermedias y pequeñas sufren presiones superiores. Los recursos de estas ciudades son, por lo general, insuficientes para cubrir la demanda de su propia población por servicios sociales básicos. El Gobierno Nacional debería ofrecer respaldo financiero e institucional a los municipios con una presión grave por los flujos de población desplazada.",R

En este trabajo, se construye un modelo de decisión de hogares que permite observar como los hogares deciden de manera simultánea el combustible a utilizar, el estado de salud de los miembros del hogar y las medidas defensivas que pueden adoptar. El modelo corrobora la hipótesis planteada: el consumo de leña tiene efectos nocivos sobre la salud; la utilización de tecnologías apropiadas para evacuar gases contaminantes puede prevenir la incidencia de infecciones respiratorias; la pobreza es el principal determinante del consumo de leña y la desnutrición aumenta la probabilidad de adquirir enfermedades respiratorias.

Para tratar de contribuir a esta discusión, este estudio incluye de manera explícita diferentes formas de medición de la condición de pobreza (Línea de Pobreza, Índice de Calidad de Vida y Pobreza de Inversión) para determinar si éste es un factor que influye en la decisión de uso de fertilizantes químicos y/u orgánicos. La investigación toma en cuenta que estos últimos tienen un impacto positivo en la acumulación de materia orgánica y por ende, contribuyen a mejorar la calidad del suelo. Los resultados indican que la pobreza, medida bajo distintos indicadores, incrementa la probabilidad de utilizar fertilizantes orgánicos frente a los químicos, con lo cual las políticas de lucha contra la pobreza deben ser complementadas con políticas de conservación del medio ambiente, en particular del suelo, para evitar o por lo menos reducir, la degradación ambiental.",I

Este trabajo estima qué tan vulnerables son los hogares colombianos y las principales características asociadas a este fenómeno, definiendo la vulnerabilidad como la probabilidad que tiene un hogar de estar en pobreza en el futuro. Los resultados muestran que alrededor del 20% de los hogares colombianos, además de estar actualmente en pobreza, tienen una alta probabilidad de permanecer en ella, i.e. son pobres crónicos. Por su parte, cerca de un 18% de los hogares son vulnerables a la pobreza, aunque no son pobres en la actualidad.

"Samuel Jaramillo","PRECIOS INMOBILIARIOS EN EL MERCADO DE VIVIENDA EN BOGOTÁ 1970-2004","Este trabajo consiste en la construcción de diferentes series de precios referidas al mercado de la vivienda en Bogotá en un período que se extiende desde 1970 hasta 2004. Se presenta inicialmente una serie atinente a la evolución del canon de alquiler a partir de las cifras construidas por el DANE para calcular el Índice de Precios al Consumidor. Como complemento y punto de contraste con esta serie, que es un Índice, se construyen cifras sobre el alquiler a partir de las ofertas publicadas en los periódicos, lo cual permite además, tener magnitudes absolutas de precios. Con una metodología similar se construyen dos series de precios de compraventa de vivienda usada y de vivienda nueva. Finalmente, se adaptan cifras producidas por la Lonja de Propiedad Raíz de Bogotá, referidas al precio de la tierra destinada a vivienda, de tal manera que sean comparables con las cifras anteriores. Este conjunto de series tienen la ventaja de ser congruentes entre sí, lo que abre la posibilidad de realizar diferentes análisis. Un cálculo en este sentido que tiene gran relevancia y que se desarrolla en el texto, es una estimación de la evolución de la rentabilidad de la inversión en alquiler de vivienda. Las series tienen una expresión agregada y una desagregación ulterior en tres estratos de ingreso. Hasta 1984 son de frecuencia anual, y a partir de allí se tienen cifras semestrales. Entre los principales rasgos que pueden extraerse de una mirada preliminar de estas cifras se pueden destacar las siguientes: los diferentes precios de la vivienda muestran una tendencia de largo plazo a la baja en términos reales bastante pronunciada. En contraste, los precios del suelo muestran un crecimiento positivo y muy acentuado. A pesar de esta disparidad los distintos mercados parecen estar muy conectados, pues las oscilaciones de los precios sobre sus respectivas tendencias son muy convergentes. La proporción del alquiler con respecto al precio de los inmuebles tiende a contraerse con el tiempo. Esto, y el hecho de que en años recientes se ha vivido una fase de depresión de precios particularmente profunda y prolongada, determina que la rentabilidad de la inversión en alquiler en la última década ha sido muy baja, incluso inferior al rendimiento de las opciones financieras más pasivas. Comienza a observarse una tendencia a la recuperación en los precios, aunque un poco desigual en los distintos estratos: más pronunciada en el submercado de altos ingresos, incipiente en los ingresos medios y más débil en los ingresos bajos.",R

It is concluded that signing preferential trade agreements with countries that have a large trade potential is likely to improve welfare, but that a minimum economic size threshold may be required for such outcome. Otherwise, preferential trade agreements may reduce welfare. The paper also demonstrates that within that framework, the lower the trade barriers towards non-member countries, the greater the economic size that may be required for preferential trade agreements to be welfare improving. This theoretical paper suggests that if small countries follow preferential trade agreement strategies such as those applied by the European Union, and more recently by the United States, Mexico and Chile, they should do so with care, clear objectives and national commitment.",F

The average travel time to work was one hour and ten minutes, obsolete buses provided public transport, traffic generated 70 percent of air pollution and there were frequent traffic accidents. To address all of these issues, the municipal and national governments designed and put in place a new mass transit system named TransMilenio (TM), which came into operation in January 2001. The purpose of this paper is to analyze Bogotá´s mass transit system before and after TM, study the political economy of its adoption process and conduct a cost-benefit analysis (CBA) of the first phase of the system. The new transit system is a hybrid model that combines public planning of the network structure, route tendering conditions, regulation and supervision, as well as private operation of the separated functions of revenue collection and transport service. The adoption of this new model needed to resolve delicate political economy issues that characterized private transport systems in many developing countries. The new organization had a sizeable impact on TM users´ by improving traveling conditions significantly. In addition, congestion, pollution and traffic accidents plummeted in TM corridors. However, the type of transition adopted for the remaining transport corridors not covered by TM caused unforeseen negative spillovers, as a consequence of slow scrapping rates and bus and routes relocation. Consequently, although the CBA for the first phase of the corridors covered by TM is positive, once these additional measures are taken into consideration, the net effect is negative due primarily to increases in travel time for passengers using the traditional transport system. In order to minimize the negative spillovers during the full implementation of TM, expected to last until 2015, integration of the traditional and new systems should be carried on, and strict regulation of the traditional public transport system should be crafted.",R

Empleando la econometría de panel para el período 1994-2002 se estimaron modelos competencia a la Bertrand y Cournot para las importaciones de ambos países, en función de los respectivos aranceles, tasas de cambio, costos de roducción y la demanda de Colombia. Los resultados permiten estimar un efecto neto positivo sobre el valor de las importaciones provenientes de ambos países por US 159 millones anuales, es decir, un 3,3%, debido al efecto conjunto de repunte en el valor de las importaciones de los EEUU y al menor valor de las compras a Venezuela. La mayor parte de los efectos corresponden a ajustes en cantidades y se concentran en las importaciones destinadas a la industria como materias primas y bienes de capital, como resultado de las elasticidades estimadas y de la estructura de comercio.",F
"RICARDO ROCHA|JUAN RICARDO PERILLA|RAMIRO LOPEZ","UNA APROXIMACIÓN DE LA POLÍTICA COMERCIAL ESTRATÉGICA PARA EL INGRESO DE COLOMBIA AL ALCA","El objetivo de la investigación es estimar los efectos que se darían sobre el bienestar (cambios en los precios relativos de la oferta de exportaciones colombiana) en un escenario para el ALCA que elimina la protección del AEC y los aranceles en el TLCAN. Se trata de una aproximación a los efectos precios que pretende enriquecer y complementar los análisis de la integración que tradicionalmente se han basado en los flujos de comercio. Empleando la técnica econométrica de panel se realizó un ejercicio retrospectivo para el período 1989-2001 con un modelo que especifica la respuesta de los precios como una función de las barreras arancelarias enfrentadas como proxi de la política comercial. Adicionalmente, estos efectos se controlan por las tasas de cambio, los costos de producción y la demanda que enfrentan las firmas colombianas vs. sus principales competidores en los mercados de Venezuela y Estados Unidos respectivamente. Los resultados permiten estimar un efecto neto negativo sobre el bienestar de US 94 millones anuales, equivalentes a una pérdida de US$144 millones en Venezuela y una ganancia de US$50 millones en los EEUU. Estos efectos se refieren a los menores precios de la oferta colombiana, particularmente de los sectores textil, confecciones y metalmecánica, frente a un escenario ALCA donde se elimina la protección que brinda el AEC.",F
"Hernán Vallejo","UNA PROPUESTA PARA LA ORIENTACIÓN DE LA POLITICA COMERCIAL COLOMBIANA EN UN CONTEXTO DE EFICIENCIA Y EQUIDAD","Este documento plantea que el objetivo principal y de largo plazo de la política comercial colombiana debe ser llegar al libre comercio internacional. Dado que Colombia es un país pequeño con poco poder para promover la liberalización multilateral del comercio, el camino para lograrlo puede ser el de los acuerdos preferenciales de comercio, siempre y cuando dichos acuerdos sirvan como base y no como obstáculo para llegar al libre comercio de bienes y servicios. En este caso, los esfuerzos se deben enfocar en consolidar ALCA y alcanzar un acuerdo preferencial de comercio con la Unión Europea, dado el potencial de comercio que estos pactos tienen para Colombia. Este documento también plantea que los efectos distributivos del libre comercio, al igual que los efectos distributivos de la mayor parte de las decisiones de los agentes privados y públicos, se deben tratar con una orientación más precisa y eficiente de la política fiscal. La evidencia muestra que en esta área Colombia puede mejorar.",F
"YADIRA DÍAZ","¿ES NECESARIO SACRIFICAR LA EQUIDAD PARA ALCANZAR DESARROLLO? EL CASO DE LAS INEQUIDADES EN MORTALIDAD INFANTIL EN COLOMBIA","Este trabajo busca explicar porque se presenta en la mortalidad infantil colombiana un fenómeno de decreciente nivel y creciente inequidad. Esto se logra a través de la búsqueda de los determinantes de la mortalidad infantil y las inequidades presentes en ellos. El objetivo último de este trabajo es enunciar opciones de política que permitan reducir la mortalidad infantil sin ir en detrimento de la equidad. Para tal efecto: a) se construyen los determinantes de la mortalidad infantil con un modelo semiparamétrico de sobrevivencia de Cox, b) se elabora un análisis de inequidades en los determinantes teóricos de la mortalidad infantil y c) se efectúan algunas simulaciones que permiten determinar el efecto de determinadas políticas sobre la mortalidad infantil y la inequidad presente en ella. Dentro de los principales hallazgos se encuentra que los mayores efectos sobre la mortalidad infantil están dados por las variables asociadas al cuidado del niño, seguidas de los factores reproductivos de la madre, los factores de saneamiento del hogar y los factores socioeconómicos, en su orden. Además las mayores inequidades se registran en las variables socioeconómicas y de saneamiento del hogar. De otro lado se encontró que las variables de cuidado del niño son las más indicadas para intervenir en contra de la mortalidad infantil por cuanto mejoran el desempeño de todos los grupos de condición socioeconómica y en mayor magnitud en los de condición baja. A su vez, el impacto obtenido por políticas de mejoramiento de los factores reproductivos de la madre ó que aumenten el gasto público no son despreciables en la medida en que además de mejorar los niveles de mortalidad infantil, también reducen las inequidades existentes, a pesar de no hacerlo de manera tan efectiva como las asociadas a cuidado del niño o saneamiento del hogar. Finalmente, también pudo concluirse que reducir mortalidad infantil a la vez que la inequidad presente en ella tan sólo será posible en la medida en que se integren políticas en salud que mejoren el cuidado del niño con políticas de desarrollo social que mejoren las condiciones socioeconómicas de los hogares.",I
"Adriana Camacho","Stress and birth outcomes: evidence from terrorist attacks in Colombia","This paper estimates the impact of random terrorist attacks (landmines) in Colombia onthe health of babies born between 1998 and 2003. The results suggest that these types of terrorist activities that occur during a woman´s first trimester of pregnancy have a negative and significant impact on child health outcomes such as birth weight and preterm deliveries, and behaviors such as use of prenatal care. These findings persist when mother fixed effects are included, suggesting that neither observable nor unobservable characteristics of the mothers are driving the results. The paper contributes to the existing literature by identifying yet another important channel through which violence affects economic well being. Given that studies have found a strong link between Low Birth Weight (LBW) and short and long-term socioeconomic outcomes, the negative consequences of violence identified in this paper may have long-term effects on economic activity.",I

La reconstrucción del eje cafetero: El caso de Armenia","A raíz del pavoroso terremoto que tuvo lugar en el Eje Cafetero colombiano en1999, que causó grandes pérdidas humanas y una gran destrucción, sobre todo del stock inmobiliario, hubo un gran esfuerzo nacional de solidaridad tanto estatal como privado para socorrer las víctimas. El principal rubro fueron recursos en la forma de subsidios a los afectados para que compraran nuevas viviendas. Pero no se tomó ninguna precaución con respecto al mercado de tierras, a pesar de que la legislación tiene interesantes instrumentos de gestión del suelo. En este estudio se hace una estimación del monto de estos subsidios que en realidad fueron apropiados por los propietarios de los terrenos, en la forma de elevación de precios del suelo y no por los damnificados. El caso es interesante porque lo observado tal vez pueda aplicarse al sistema general de subsidios a la vivienda que constituye el eje central de la política gubernamental de vivienda social.",R

"Samuel Jaramillo","Urbanización informal: diagnósticos y políticas. Una revisión al debate latinoamericano para pensar líneas de acción actuales","En América Latina uno de los debates más animados y más ricos con respecto a nuestra realidad social ha sido el que se ha desarrollado a lo largo de décadas a propósito de la urbanización espontánea, marginal, informal, las denominaciones cambian, pero se refieren a las prácticas de hacer ciudad desarrolladas por los mismos pobladores empobrecidos y que constituyen uno de los elementos definitorios de nuestras urbes. Las interpretaciones se han sucedido unas a otras y se han contrapuesto, en ocasiones con no poca originalidad desde el punto de vista conceptual, y han estado ligadas a líneas de política que han inspirado acciones estatales concretas. El momento actual no es una excepción, con la noción liberal de informalidad y sus políticas asociadas de subsidios a la demanda y legalización de la tenencia que son el referente de las políticas dominantes al respecto. Lo peculiar, sin embargo es que los defensores de esta visión,  y tal vez sus crítico, tienden a ignorar los antecedentes  de estas discusiones y,  quizás sin saberlo, repiten en versiones empobrecidas o ignoran, elementos de discusión muy valiosos que hubieran podido considerarse como conquistas conceptuales si el pensamiento sobre lo social fuera solamente acumulativo. En este texto se hace una rápida y esquemática revisión de este debate, con un propósito: enmarcar la discusión actual y precisar las referencias para desarrollar una interpretación desde la tradición marxista, que recupere estos aportes, pero que introduzca desarrollos contemporáneos ligados al desarrollo actual de este marco conceptual. Se exploran entonces nociones como la simultaneidad de prácticas de agentes heterogéneos en un mismo espacio mercantil, la articulación entre producción, circulación y consumo, de diversas formas de producción, la emergencia de rentas urbanas asociadas a prácticas mercantiles simples que la reflexión marxista de los años setenta apenas esbozaba y que hoy en día pueden ser muy fructíferas en términos de interpretación y de diseño de líneas de acción.",R

Esta actividad va cambiando  con las transformaciones en las prácticas urbanísticas. Frente al urbanismo funcionalista hubo  en los años setenta y ochenta una primera oleada de exploraciones a partir de la teoría marxista de la renta, que aportaron cambios importantes en la perspectiva, de manera paralela y en conexión con esfuerzos similares en otras regiones. En contraste con esos otros contextos en los cuales el urbanismo neoliberal impuso la teorización de la economía neoclásica  a partir de los años noventa y la investigación crítica sobre el tema prácticamente desapareció, en América Latina hubo una cierta continuidad, en especial en países como Brasil y Colombia. Ante la emergencia de procesos políticos progresistas en las ciudades de la región existe un renacer desarrollos teóricos críticos: aquí se analizan aportes dentro de la reflexión heterodoxa en economía, y de la teoría de la renta del suelo urbano con acercamientos marxistas renovados que pretenden generar interpretaciones e instrumentos de política al servicio de un urbanismo democrático.",R

"Sergio Clavijo","CRECIMIENTO, PRODUCTIVIDAD Y LA 'NUEVA ECONOMÍA': Implicaciones para Colombia","Este trabajo aborda el tema de los llamados &#8220;motores del crecimiento&#8221;, donde las explicaciones se relacionan mas estrechamente con la política económica y, en menor medida, con los factores exógenos, tales como la geografía, la demografía o la inestabilidad institucional. Se trata de explicar el crecimiento y la productividad como resultantes de determinadas políticas económicas: la intensidad del comercio internacional y su impacto tecnológico, la tasa de inversión bruta y su relación con la productividad multifactorial, los efectos de la relación capital/trabajo. La conclusión básica es que la tasa de crecimiento de largo plazo (1950-2002) ha estado íntimamente relacionada con la tasa de inversión, observándose una elasticidad casi unitaria, y con el comportamiento del sector externo. A su vez, la productividad laboral y multifactorial muestran un comportamiento pro-cíclico. La apertura comercial juega un papel importante en la determinación del crecimiento y la productividad a través del comportamiento de la inversión y la relación tecnológica capital/trabajo. La tasa de cambio real sería mas un resultado que un determinante de la productividad de largo plazo. Por último, analizamos la productividad en el corto plazo, en el marco de las llamadas reglas de Taylor, las cuales fijan las tasas de interés del banco central.",F

"Franz Hamann|Julián Pérez|Paulina Restrepo","Sobre los Efectos Macroeconómicos de la Composición de la Deuda Pública en Colombia","Este artículo presenta un análisis cuantitativo del impacto macroeconómico de la forma como se financia el déficit fiscal en una economía pequeña y abierta. En particular, nos enfocamos en evaluar el impacto macroeconómico de una situación en la que, dado un nivel de déficit fiscal, el gobierno decide entre financiarlo con deuda doméstica o externa. Para este propósito empleamos un modelo de equilibrio general dinámico y estocástico para una economía pequeña y abierta. Al calibrar el modelo a la economía colombiana, encontramos que los efectos de una sustitución de deuda pública externa por interna dependen de qué tan permanente sea dicha sustitución. Una sustitución transitoria tiene efectos macroeconómicos despreciables, con excepción de su impacto sobre los flujos de capital privados (&#8220;efecto portafolio&#8221;). Es decir, un aumento de la deuda pública doméstica vis a vis una reducción en la externa, es balanceado por una reducción de los activos externos netos privados. Por el contrario, una sustitución permanente de un 10% de deuda externa por doméstica tiene efectos macroeconómicos transitorios pero considerables sobre la actividad real y los flujos de capital. Dicha recomposición genera un aumento en los activos externos netos de un 5% acompañada de una depreciación nominal cercana al 1 %. Aunque nuestros resultados son generales en ambientes con flexibilidad de precios, especulamos que pueden variar en presencia de incertidumbre acerca de la sostenibilidad de las finanzas públicas y/o rigideces nominales y reales.",F
"Adolfo Meisel|Margarita Vega","THE STATURE OF THE COLOMBIAN ELITE BEFORE THE ONSET OF INDUSTRIALIZATION, 1870-1919","The average height of Colombian women increased 8.95 cm between 1905 and 1985 and of men 8.96 cm in the same time period. Thus the country was a success story according to international standards in this respect. The information for the adult height of Colombians born between 1905 and 1985 was obtained from a database with more than 9 million observations constructed with the national ID cards. This implies that the results are indicative of what happened to the overall population. For the pre-industrial era in Colombia, which is before the 20th century, information on height is only available from 1870. The source in this case is the records of the passports issued to Colombian citizens, for which we have obtained about 17.000 observations. The analysis of those records for the period 1870-1919 reveals some striking results. In the first place, the long run behavior of height was stable, unlike what is observed with the national ID card records, beginning in 1905, in which case heights were increasing. The group included in the passport records is much taller than those from the ID card. For the period 1905-1909 the average passport height for men was 168.7 cm compared with 162 cm for national ID cards. In the case of women the former had an average height of 158 cm and the later 150 cm.",I

"Meisel Roca Adolfo|Margarita Vega","La estatura de la élite colombiana antes de la industrialización, 1870 -1919","La estatura promedio de los colombianos nacidos entre 1905 y 1985 se incrementó en 8,9 cms., lo cual refleja un resultado exitoso con relación a los estándares internacionales de calidad de vida. La información de estatura para este período proviene de la base de datos de la cédula de ciudadanía, con más de nueve millones de observaciones, lo que implica que estos resultados son representativos de lo que sucedió para toda la población en su conjunto. Para el período anterior a la industrialización en Colombia, solamente se encuentra información sobre estatura para los nacidos desde 1870. En este caso, la fuente de datos son los registros de pasaportes entregados a colombianos entre 1918 y 1940, para los cuales se obtuvieron más de 15.000 observaciones. La base de datos utilizada en el presente trabajo reúne observaciones de la estatura adulta de los colombianos nacidos entre 1870 y 1919, pertenecientes principalmente a la élite. Los resultados de este análisis son bastante sorprendentes. En primer lugar, la tendencia de largo plazo de la estatura fue estable, contrario a lo observado con los registros de la cédula, que inician en 1905 y donde la estatura se incrementó en forma sostenida. Un segundo punto a resaltar es que el grupo que incluyen los pasaportes es mucho más alto que el proveniente de la cédula. Para el período 1905-1909 la estatura promedio de los hombres de pasaportes fue 168,7 cms., comparado con el promedio nacional de 162 cms., obtenido de la base de datos de las cédulas. En el caso de las mujeres, las primeras alcanzaron una estatura promedio de 158 cms y las últimas 150 cms. Otra característica encontrada en la muestra de pasaportes es que no se presentaron diferencias regionales, como lo observado en el caso de la base de datos de la cédula. La razón del porqué difiere el comportamiento de la estatura de los colombianos obtenida de los pasaportes, de la registrada con la base de datos de la cédula, es que en el siglo XIX y comienzos del XX los colombianos que viajaban al exterior, principalmente a Europa y Estados Unidos, pertenecían a la élite. Por ello, tenían mejores niveles de nutrición y condiciones de vida, por lo cual eran relativamente altos, inclusive en relación a los estándares de los países europeos en ese momento. Sin embargo, la estatura de las personas nacidas entre 1870-1919 obtenida a través de la cedula, es inferior a la de los colombianos nacidos en 1985. Mientras que la estatura promedio de los hombres nacidos en 1900 obtenida de los pasaportes fue de 168,2 cms., los colombianos nacidos en 1985 crecieron hasta un promedio de 170,6 cms. La razón, para esto último, fue probablemente que las condiciones de salud bajo las cuales se encontraba la élite limitaban el crecimiento de su estatura. Sólo hasta finales de la década de 1920, cuando se dan los avances internacionales en medicina, podrían haber empezado a eliminarse las barreras para los avances en la estatura de la élite.",I

Sinembargo, se debe relativizar esta subida, porque las cifras abastecidas por los organismos oficialesno reflejan siempre la realidad. Por otro lado, el caso de Brasil se distingue radicalmente del deChina, porque la evolución de los salarios se acompaña allí de una baja fuerte de las desigualdadessobre el mercado de trabajo entre los trabajadores cualificados y no cualificados, mientras queen China, estas últimas no dejen de crecer desde la década 1980.

"Gerson Javier Pérez V.","Bolívar: industrial, agropecuario y turístico","A pesar de ser la industria el sector más representativo en la producción de Bolívar, no sólo se concentra en una parte muy pequeña del territorio, sino que genera empleo en una parte muy reducida de la población. Por otro lado, las actividades del sector primario tales como la agricultura, ganadería, minería y las actividades artesanales, son el sustento de los habitantes de los municipios diferentes a la capital. Mientras que el Bolívar cartagenero es industrial, portuario y turístico, el resto del departamento es fundamentalmente agropecuario. El documento presenta una perspectiva amplia sobre los aspectos más relevantes del departamento a partir de los años noventa. En algunos casos se plantean recomendaciones de política que pueden contribuir a la discusión sobre el crecimiento económico del departamento. Los resultados muestran que si bien Bolívar afronta una situación que lo ubica dentro de los entes territoriales más pobres y menos desarrollados del país y de la región, con apoyo del gobierno nacional ha logrado mejorar algunos aspectos importantes como la cobertura en servicios básicos, salud, educación, servicios públicos e infraestructura vial. Sin embargo, hace falta un camino bastante largo en el mejoramiento de la situación de los habitantes del departamento, lo cual puede lograrse únicamente con el compromiso del gobierno departamental y de los gobiernos locales de realizar un manejo eficiente de los recursos.",R
"Jaime Bonet","Cambio estructural regional en Colombia: una aproximación con matrices insumo-producto","No existen estudios previos orientados al análisis de las interacciones entre las economías regionales en Colombia. Una exploración inicial de la interacción entre regiones sugiere un país con una interdependencia espacial limitada. Estos hallazgos fueron evaluados a través del desarrollo de un modelo de insumo-producto multiregional. Los efectos directos e indirectos de los eslabonamientos de producción son capturados a través de la evaluación de las matrices inversas de Leontief. Los resultados sugieren que los sectores claves se han trasladado de los primarios y secundarios a los terciarios, un movimiento frecuentemente observado en el proceso de desarrollo económico. Sin embargo, se puede argumentar que las economías regionales no tienen las mismas estructuras de eslabonamientos. Las diferencias son el resultado de las discrepancias en los sectores dominantes en cada economía. Las integraciones entre regiones revelan un país con sectores auto-suficientes en la mayoría de las regiones, lo que apoya los resultados encontrados en los estudios previos en el sentido de una baja dependencia inter-regional. Debido a que los sectores con los más fuertes eslabonamientos se encuentran concentrados en las regiones prósperas, existe una alta probabilidad que las desigualdades regionales existentes permanezcan en el mediano plazo.",R

"Jaime Bonet","Desindustrialización y terciarización espuria en el departamento del Atlántico, 1990 - 2005","Luego de un acelerado crecimiento económico en la segunda mitad del siglo XIX y la primera del siglo XX, el departamento del Atlántico ha experimentado un estancamiento social y económico en las últimas décadas. Los distintos indicadores sociales muestran un deterioro en las condiciones de vida de sus habitantes y en el aparato productivo departamental, lo que no le ha permitido recuperar el papel protagónico de otros años. Se ha generado un proceso de desindustrialización en la estructura económica departamental, el cual, a su vez, ha estado acompañado de una terciarización espuria. Este estancamiento se explica por diferentes factores: el proceso de aglomeración regional que ha experimentado el país, la baja formación del recurso humano, la deficiente infraestructura de servicios y portuaria, la poca vinculación del aparato productivo departamental con los mercados externos y los cambios organizacionales al interior de los grupos económicos nacionales. La consolidación de una zona portuaria sin restricciones de calado, un programa de mejoramiento de la educación departamental y una mayor inserción de la economía local en el mercado internacional serían fundamentales para retomar una senda de crecimiento sostenido. Esta tarea exige la presencia de unos gobiernos locales con balances fiscales sólidos que les permita financiar los proyectos de inversión requeridos.",R

El documento pretende establecer si existen evidencias acerca de dependencia espacial en las medidas de la pobreza en los departamentos y municipios del país. Esto se realiza a través del cálculo del estadístico I de Moran a nivel global y local. La metodología permite además ubicar clusters de pobreza, así como detectar si existió algún proceso de difusión de la pobreza. Los resultados muestran evidencias significativas de dependencia espacial tanto a nivel departamental como municipal, indicando que la ubicación geográfica es importante como determinante de la pobreza en el país. Es decir, que el hecho de que cada municipio tenga los vecinos que tiene es determinante fundamental para explicar la pobreza. Se encontraron clusters y procesos de difusión en algunos municipios y departamentos. Se destaca que en la mayoría de los casos los municipios pobres están rodeados de otros municipios pobres, y que los municipios ricos están rodeados de ricos. Esto podría ser el resultado tanto de correlaciones en las dotaciones naturales de factores, de externalidades o una combinación de ambas.",R
"Joaquín Viloria De La Hoz","Educación Primaria en Cartagena: Análisis de cobertura, costos y eficiencia","En el Distrito de Cartagena diversos factores obstaculizan la eficiente asignación de los recursos educativos: no menos del 95% de los recursos del sector se destinan a gastos de personal, el costo promedio por estudiante de un colegio oficial en Cartagena corresponde a sólo un 50% de lo que cuesta en un colegio oficial de Bogotá, y la ampliación de la cobertura educativa se hace con frecuencia a costa de la calidad. Para mejorar los logros y la efectividad de las políticas educativas, es necesario incidir directamente en algunos factores determinantes del aprendizaje. En tal sentido, se debe lograr que los planteles educativos dispongan de bibliotecas bien dotadas, que los rectores asuman un rol de liderazgo dentro del plantel, que se cumpla estrictamente con el número de horas de clases y que se asignen los mejores maestros a primero de primaria. Es preocupante constatar que muchas de estas acciones no son tenidas en cuenta por las autoridades educativas, a pesar de su bajo costo y alta efectividad.",I
"Luis Armando Galvis Aponte|Adolfo Meisel Roca","El crecimiento económico de la ciudades colombianas y sus determinantes, 1973-1998","Colombia se ha caracterizado por tener un desarrollo económico regional equilibrado y por la existencia de varias ciudades importantes, en contraposición al patrón latinoamericano de la dominación de la red urbana por parte de una sola ciudad. Sin embargo, a partir de las últimas tres décadas, esta situación ha cambiado, y se ha incrementado la importancia de Bogotá en la economía nacional. En este trabajo se estudia la evolución de las disparidades económicas entre las principales ciudades colombianas y los determinantes de su crecimiento. Puesto que para Colombia no hay cálculos disponibles del PIB urbano, utilizamos como proxy de esta variable los depósitos bancarios per cápita reales. La muestra seleccionada para el análisis incluye 20 de las principales ciudades de Colombia, las cuales representan el 42% de la población nacional y contribuyen con más del 50% del PIB total. Los resultados muestran que durante el período 1973-1998 no hubo convergencia beta (&#946;) ni convergencia sigma (&#948;). Las estimaciones econométricas señalan que los principales determinantes del crecimiento en el PIB per cápita de las ciudades colombianas son: el nivel de capital humano, la infraestructura urbana y de telecomunicaciones, las variables institucionales, el PIB per cápita inicial, y el tamaño del mercado local. Las variables geográficas no son significativas en nuestro análisis. Estos resultados coinciden con los trabajos recientes de Edward L. Glaeser sobre el crecimiento urbano, en los cuales se resalta la importancia de las externalidades del conocimiento, y también con los de Paul Krugman, que enfatizan el rol de las economías de escala.",R
"Jaime Bonet","Inequidad espacial en la dotación educativa regional en Colombia","Este artículo estudia los cambios en la inequidad de la dotación educativa en Colombia entre 1968 y 2000 en términos de desigualdades intra e inter regionales. Se introducen recientes técnicas analíticas para examinar las consecuencias de los efectos espaciales en la evolución de la desigualdad. Adicionalmente, se analiza la relación existente entre los regímenes administrativos intergubernamentales y las inequidades. Los resultados indican que los efectos espaciales incrementan las desigualdades en la dotación educativa entre regiones y al interior de las mismas. Mientras que la descentralización está asociada con tasas de crecimiento altas en la dotación educativa, las medidas de desigualdad registran una mayor disminución durante los períodos de administración centralizada. Debido a que actualmente la educación opera bajo un esquema descentralizado y a que el malestar social aún persisten en Colombia, la adopción de un componente redistributivo y la incorporación de una dimensión espacial deben ser prioritarias en la modificación de las políticas diseñadas para reducir las disparidades en la dotación educativa regional.",I
"Adolfo Meisel Roca","La continentalización de la isla de San Andrés, Colombia: Panyas, raizales y turismo, 1953-2003","El archipiélago de San Andrés y Providencia, Colombia, ubicado a 180 kilómetros de la costa de Nicaragua e inicialmente poblado por colonos ingleses y sus esclavos, se caracterizó hasta 1953 por que la mayoría de su población hablaba una variante caribeña del inglés, era protestante y negra. Sin embargo, desde que las islas se declararon como puerto libre en 1953, hubo una enorme inmigración de continentales colombianos que transformaron por completo su economía y sociedad. Ello fue especialmente cierto para San Andrés, ya que Providencia se mantuvo relativamente aislada de estos cambios. En este trabajo se estudian las principales etapas en la historia económica de San Andrés. El periodo posterior a la declaratoria del puerto libre recibe una atención especial por la importancia que tiene para entender la crisis actual de la isla. El rápido crecimiento de la población debido a la inmigración, por encima del 20% a comienzos de la década de 1960, llevó a la marginación social y económica de los raizales o nativos, los cuales en la actualidad representan menos del 50% de la población. El tema de la sobrepoblación se discute ya que muchos líderes locales consideran que se trata del principal problema que afecta a San Andrés. Finalmente, se enfatiza la importancia que para el archipiélago tiene el fortalecimiento de las ventajas competitivas para el turismo, sobre el cual principalmente dependerá su prosperidad económica en el futuro.",R

En este trabajo estudiamos el proceso de descentralización colombiano durante la década de 1990 desde una óptica regional, y haciendo especial énfasis en las disparidades tanto económicas como en las transferencias de recursos a las regiones. Además, se presenta la evidencia que muestra que durante la primera década de la descentralización introducida por la Constitución de 1991 aumentaron las disparidades económicas territoriales en Colombia. También se ilustra cómo las transferencias fiscales no contribuyeron a reducir esa inequidad.

Sus características geográficas y climáticas son variadas, con unas zonas ricas en agua pero anegadizas, donde no existen sistemas de drenajes, y otras secas y carentes de sistemas de riego. Este trabajo examina los factores que han frenado su desarrollo económico y social, encontrando una producción primaria con bajo valor agregado y deficiente infraestructura física en servicios públicos, vías y comunicaciones. Los indicadores sociales y económicos han mejorado en el transcurso de los últimos años pero están rezagados con relación a los promedios del país. Existe un gran potencial en la producción agroindustrial, microempresarial y artesanal, pero los productores carecen de recursos, presentan deficiencias en la administración de sus negocios y tienen alta intermediación. Las finanzas públicas del departamento y sus municipios dependen en alta proporción de las transferencias de la Nación, por la poca dinámica de las actividades económicas locales y el alto nivel de pobreza de la población. Para lograr un mayor desarrollo es indispensable mejorar la infraestructura económica (vías, aeropuertos, sistemas de drenaje y riego, entre otras) con la cual se aumentará la productividad de las actividades actuales y se atraerá nuevas inversiones productivas.",R
"José R. Gamarra V.","La economía del Cesar después del algodón","Desde su creación en la década de 1960, el departamento del Cesar ha recorrido los picos más pronunciados de los ciclos económicos y sociales. En la década de 1970 se cayeron los precios del algodón y con ellos el auge económico con el que empezó el departamento. En la década de 1980 la economía se estancó, y en los noventa la crisis se intensificó. A partir de 1995 empiezan las exportaciones de carbón, el valor de estas exportaciones hizo que la caída de los indicadores económicos del Cesar no fuera tan grave. La minería ha tenido efectos positivos sobre su área de influencia directa por medio de la creación de empleos y regalías. A pesar de la importancia en las finanzas municipales, la ejecución de las regalías no ha sido la más eficaz, y no se han traducido en mayores logros de servicios básicos. Para los mismos años que empezaron las exportaciones de carbón, los indicadores de pobreza en el departamento muestran un desmejoramiento de las condiciones de vida en el Cesar. La situación de servicios básicos, de infraestructura y de educación muestran un rezago del Cesar con respecto al país y otros departamentos de la región. Bajo este panorama se puede ver un proceso de ajuste de la economía departamental en los últimos años. La década de 1990 se caracterizó por la consolidación de la ganadería y el cultivo de palma, la disminución de los cultivos transitorios y el afianzamiento de la miner ía de carbón.",R

El primero es caracterizar los procesos inflacionarios en las siete principales ciudades colombianas y el segundo es establecer si se cumple la versión relativa de la Paridad del Poder Adquisitivo como evidencia de integración de los mercados urbanos. Para alcanzar este segundo objetivo se realizan pruebas de raíz unitaria sobre los diferenciales de inflación y se evalúan las hipótesis de convergencia estocástica de Bernard y Durlauf y de convergencia tipo sigma. Se encontró que la inflación en las ciudades es bastante similar aún en el grupo de vivienda que está compuesto de bienes presuntamente de baja transabilidad. También se encuentra que se cumple la hipótesis de la versión relativa de la PPA en un gran número de casos entre las ciudades colombianas y, por consiguiente, evidencia de convergencia estocástica y de integración. Esta convergencia se presenta más claramente entre las tasas de inflación de alimentos, en este estudio usadas como inflación de los bienes transables, que en la inflación del grupo de vivienda.",R

La metodología utilizada es la de los índices encadenados, específicamente aquella conocida como cadenas de Fisher. El objetivo principal es establecer si hay evidencia sobre la necesidad de construir un ITCR para cada departamento o región ó, si el índice nacional es una aproximación adecuada de cada uno de ellos. Para tal fin, se hace uso de algunas herramientas estadísticas y econométricas, como son los coeficientes de correlación, regresión ortogonal, causalidades y cointegración. Los resultados encontrados indican que las correlaciones entre los ITCRs departamentales y el índice nacional son bastante altas: entre el 53% y el 96%. Otras pruebas como las de cointegración y causalidad mostraron que sólo para el caso de unos pocos departamentos el ITCR presenta alguna relación con el índice nacional; en el caso de la intercambiabilidad, el ITCR de ninguno de los departamentos parece ser intercambiable con el índice nacional. La misma situación ocurrió para el caso de las regiones. Aunque los resultados parecen no ser homogéneos, por lo cual se plantea la necesidad de evaluar la posible utilización de otro tipo de medidas, las evidencias arrojadas parecen mostrar la necesidad de construir un índice de tasa de cambio real para cada departamento o región, acorde con las características comerciales particulares de cada uno de ellos.",F

En 1999 había sembradas 52.000 hectáreas, que produjeron 205.000 toneladas de aceite de palma y de palmiste crudo, de las cuales se exportó el 21%. Las tierras aptas para la siembra de este cultivo están utilizadas en un 2%, lo que da la posibilidad de más explotaciónes de este producto, que tiene una diversidad de usos y cuya demanda es creciente. Las alianzas productivas entre pequeños y medianos productores con grandes empresarios y el Estado, han integrado los factores productivos en un modelo de desarrollo solidario, con la creación de un número considerable de cooperativas que convierten a los campesinos en dueños de la tierra, haciéndolos participes de un negocio muy rentable como lo es la actividad palmera.",R

Los resultados señalan que el crecimiento económico de los centros urbanos costeños, medido en términos del PIB per cápita, y sus coberturas en servicios sociales, son relativamente inferiores al de las ciudades más importantes de Colombia. No obstante, la ubicación estratégica que éstas poseen para el comercio internacional, el constituirse en el corredor portuario más importante a nivel nacional, y su enorme potencial turístico e industrial, son factores claves que requieren ser fortalecidos para tratar de revertir las disparidades en el crecimiento económico regional. Así mismo, el desarrollo social desequilibrado que hoy existe entre estas tres ciudades y las del resto del país, solo podrá ser superado con una mayor eficiencia en el uso y asignación de la inversión pública, mejoramiento de la calidad y cobertura educativa, ampliación de las coberturas de salud y una adecuada infraestructura de servicios públicos.

El presente documento estudia las principales características socioeconómicas de este municipio con especial énfasis en las dinámicas económicas. Tubará, al igual que muchos de los municipios del país con menos de 20.000 habitantes, presenta problemas en la prestación de servicios públicos domiciliarios a sus habitantes, especialmente en agua, alcantarillado y gas. El sistema educativo, aunque ha mejorado su cobertura en los últimos años, aún exhibe problemas serios de calidad. La economía en el municipio, principalmente de agricultura de subsistencia, es poco dinámica, lo que resulta en la baja calidad de vida de sus habitantes y en la acentuada pobreza.

En este trabajo se calcula un índice de costo de vida comparativo. Se trata de un deflactor regional que puede ser utilizado para comparar otras variables asociadas a la demanda, tales como el ingreso laboral. Para expresar las diferencias regionales en el costo de vida se propone la construcción de un indicador que compara el gasto mínimo de cada ciudad con el escenario alternativo, es decir, que este mismo plan sea evaluado en la situación de precios de las demás ciudades.

Para ello se calculan cinco medidas a partir de los datos de Producto Interno Bruto, PIB, per-cápita departamental y se comparan con las de otros países. Sobre la misma variable se hace un análisis de dependencia espacial en las regiones colombianas. Los principales resultados son: Primero, el PIB per-cápita de los departamentos más pobres estaba en 1980 alrededor del 45% del de Colombia, en el año 2000 esa proporción aún era la misma; segundo, las diferentes medidas de disparidad, en su mayoría, muestran un aumento de las disparidades en la década de 1990; tercero, se encuentra evidencia sobre la existencia de convergencia de los niveles de ingreso en la década de 1980, pero no en la década de 1990, en la que las disparidades han aumentado considerablemente ante la ausencia de una política regional explícita y clara; cuarto, se concluye que el PIB per-cápita departamental no muestra patrones de dependencia espacial de ningún tipo, por lo que se puede afirmar que la riqueza o pobreza está aleatoriamente distribuida en la geografía nacional. Por último, se muestra que las disparidades que presenta Colombia no son particularmente altas si se comparan con las de otros países.",R
"Laura Cepeda Emiliani","La economía de Risaralda después del café: ¿Hacia dónde va?","La economía del departamento de Risaralda en el siglo XX pasó de ser una economía agrícola, principalmente por sus cultivos de café, a una basada sobre todo en el comercio y los servicios. El declive de la economía cafetera hizo que los tres departamentos del llamado Eje Cafetero (Caldas, Quindío y Risaralda), tomaran trayectorias divergentes. Por esa razón, es necesario estudiar su evolución económica reciente por separado. El objetivo de este trabajo es presentar evidencia descriptiva acerca de la evolución económica reciente de Risaralda. Gracias a los recursos generados en el pasado por el café, el departamento cuenta con una buena infraestructura y buenos índices de capital humano, en comparación con otros departamentos. Sin embargo, se observa un deterioro reciente de la calidad de vida de sus habitantes, evidenciado en las cifras de pobreza y desempleo. En cuanto a su economía, se encuentra que si bien la actividad comercial ha sido una vocación tradicional de su población, estas no es capaz de generar un alto valor agregado ni empleo de calidad. ABSTRACT:During the 20th century, Risaralda´s economy went from being an agricultural-based (primarily due to coffee production) to being based on commerce and services. This reduction of the coffee production has made the paths the economies of the so called Eje Cafetero (Caldas, Quindío y Risaralda) diverge. Thus the study of these three departments must be done separately. This paper´s objective is to present descriptive evidence about Risaralda´s recent economic evolution. The department has good infrastructure and human capital, thanks to the resources generated by the coffee economy in the past. However, recently there has been a recent reduction of the quality of life that can be seen through poverty and unemployment rates. Regarding its economy, even though commercial activities have responded to a traditional vocation of its people, these activities do not generate quality employment.",R
"Andrés Sánchez Jabba","El bilingüismo en los bachilleres colombianos","Colombia is a country with low bilingual proficiency amongst its high school students. Systematically, foreign language test scores of the State Examination (Saber 11) indicate that the vast majority of students who finalize secondary education exhibit low proficiency on their ability to use and understand the English language. Nonetheless, students from bilingual schools achieve significantly higher scores compared to the rest of the student population. In this study, it's demonstrated that the Caribbean Coast's bilingual students have attained a high level of bilingualism when compared to their peers in other Colombian regions, given its tradition of bilingual education. As an explanation for the Caribbean Coast's bilingual students' performance, I propose the region's comparatively high levels of foreign immigration as a factor which contributed to the early establishment of bilingual schools, which can be viewed as a comparative advantage endemic to students from this region. RESUMEN: Colombia es un país con un bajo nivel de bilingüismo entre la población estudiantil. Sistemáticamente, los resultados del área de idiomas de la Prueba de Estado para la Evaluación de la Educación Media, Saber 11, indican que la gran mayoría de los estudiantes que culminan sus estudios de educación media tienen un bajo nivel de inglés. No obstante, existe un grupo de estudiantes cuyo desempeño en la prueba de idiomas es significativamente alto en comparación con el resto: los bilingües. En esta investigación se demuestra que los estudiantes bilingües costeños han alcanzado un nivel de bilingüismo superior al de sus pares en otras regiones de Colombia, lo cual sucede a pesar de que en otras áreas del conocimiento su desempeño tiende a ser inferior y que, en términos generales, la región Caribe presenta un bajo nivel de bilingüismo. Como explicación a este resultado se propone el temprano establecimiento, en el Caribe colombiano, de colegios con tradición bilingüe.Ello representa una ventaja para esta región y se relaciona con la inmigración que tuvo lugar en la misma entre finales del siglo XIX y principios del siglo XX.",I
"Andrés Sánchez Jabba","Crisis en la frontera","Este trabajo analiza las causas de la reciente crisis económica en la frontera colombo-venezolana en Cúcuta a raíz de la devaluación del bolívar y el rompimiento de las relaciones comerciales binacionales. Los resultados sugieren que el ciclo económico de esta región presenta una alta dependencia por la economía del vecino país, de manera que los desequilibrios cambiarios y políticos han tenido un efecto considerable sobre los sectores reales de la economía cucuteña. Ello genera la necesidad de considerar políticas de desarrollo territorial que incorporen las especificidades de estas regiones, que se encuentran integradas con economías vecinas y, por ende, expuestas a choques externos que afectan su desempeño económico.******ABSTRACT: This study analyzes the causes of the recent economic crisis in Cucuta, Colombia, which stems from the devaluation of the Venezuelan currency and the breakup of the commercial relations between the two countries. Results suggest that this regions economic cycle exhibits a sharp dependence upon the Venezuelan economy. Therefore, exchange and political shocks had a substantial impact on real urban economic sectors. This reflects the necessity of considering territorial development policies that take into account the specificities of borderline regions, which are naturally attached to neighboring economies, and hence, exposed to external shocks that affect economic performance.",R

"Atallah Murra Sonia","Revaluando la transmisión de spillovers de la IED: un estudio de productividad para Colombia","En los últimos años muchos países, incluyendo a Colombia, le han dado la bienvenida a mayores flujos de Inversión Extranjera Directa (IED) motivados, entre otras razones, por la expectativa de que su presencia genere beneficios indirectos sobre la productividad de las empresas locales (spillovers de productividad). Sin embargo, estos beneficios no han sido confirmados por la evidencia econométrica. A la luz de lo anterior, esta investigación indaga sobre la existencia de una relación entre la presencia de IED y la productividad de las empresas manufactureras en Colombia para el período 1995-2000. Los resultados obtenidos indican que i) los encadenamientos hacia atrás que las empresas extranjeras establecen con proveedores de insumos en Colombia son un importante canal de difusión de spillovers de productividad, ii) los encadenamientos hacia delante que las empresas extranjeras crean con clientes locales no parecen tener ningún efecto en la productividad de los últimos. iii) los efectos positivos de la IED en los sectores mismos en los que la IED se ubica parecen estar asociados a los efectos competencia que ésta genera, y parecen disminuir entre mayor sea el grado de apertura al comercio exterior.",F
"Light Miles K.","FTAA and Service Liberalization in Colombia","In a previous study we found that accession to the FTAA could be welfareworsening for Colombia because exports to the USA will be diverted away from Colombia in favor of other Latin countries. In this paper we show that there remain potentially large gains from an FTAA-style agreement. These gains come from increased factor productivity and product variety as a result of service liberalization and foreign direct investment (FDI). These benefits are likely to be large enough to overcome the loss of competitiveness in US goods markets. We use a computable general equilibrium model of the Colombian economy that includes imperfect competition in order to highlight the pro-competitive effects from entry as well as productivity effects from increased product variety. In contrast to perfect competition models, such as the GTAP model, this analysis incorporates productivity effects in both goods and services markets endogenously, through a Dixit-Stiglitz framework. The numerical model is innovative as it recognizes that foreign direct investment or the availability of foreign expertise is necessary to have foreign firms compete in key business services; and it endogenously captures increases in total factor productivity from foreign direct investment liberalization.",F
"Sánchez Fabio y Hernández Gustavo Adolfo","Colombia: aumento de las exportaciones y sus efectos sobre el crecimiento, empleo y pobreza","Colombia reduced import protection along with explicit export promotion schemes in the early 1990s. Capital flows were liberalized although some restrictions on short-term inflows were retained to reduce volatility. Output growth was led by exports in the second half of the 1980s, but the rise in capital inflows and the related real exchange rate appreciation, triggered a domestic demand boom for nontraded goods in the early 1990s. Public spending in particular was up in this period and jumped from 20% to 36% of GDP between 1990 and 1999. In the first half of the decade, economic growth accelerated to 4.6% per annum. This `go´ phase of the economy was followed by a prolonged `stop´ after 1997. The economy shrank between 1997 and 2000 mainly due to a collapse of private investment. Non-traditional export growth had been the engine of the economy in the late 1980s, but manufacturing exports actually declined during 1997-2000. Nonetheless, Manufactured exports now constitute more than 50% of total exports (up from 27% around 1980), as the decline in traditional exports (most notably, coffee) was even more severe. The share of coffee in total exports dropped from 60% to barely 10% between 1977-2000 and coffee exports suffered a major crisis after 1997. The capacity of the economy to generate jobs deteriorated notably. Productivity growth during the first years of the opening process implied virtually no employment growth in the first half of the 1990s, but average real wages could increase. The decline of the economy in the second half affected workers severely and by 2000 the open unemployment rate was up at an unprecedented 20%. The poor employment performance hit unskilled workers hardest. As a result income inequality has increased steeply and the Gini coefficient moved up from 0,467 to 0,544 between 1990 and 2000, mainly as the result of a widening earnings gap between skilled and unskilled workers. In consequence, economic growth did virtually nothing to reduce poverty. Simulations with a CGE for Colombia suggest that these trends are not due to static gains (or losses) from trade liberalization. Further trade liberalization (unilateral or negotiated in the context of FTAA or WTO) appears mildly positive for economic growth and labour incomes. Labour income gains seem mainly concentrated among unskilled workers. Hence, it wasn´t trade reform, but macroeconomic policies and external shocks which pushed the economy and poverty down and inequality up.",F

"Bourguignon Francois","Crime as a Social Cost of Poverty and Inequality: A Review Focusing on Developing countries","When rural life was still dominant in nowadays industrialized countries, cities were often seen by villagers as the domain of evil, the realm of corruption and violence. The process of accelerated urbanization and economic development was then seen as inherently wicked. The widely publicized criminality and violence observed today in several metropolises of both the developed and developing world would seem to justify a posteriori this bucolic bias. The alarming surge of crime and violence in México, Rio or Sao Paulo during the last 20 years or so might indeed be the result of an excessively rapid growth of these 'gigapolises'. Likewise, the increasing minor cirminality experienced today in many large cities' suburbs in developed countries might be the delayed consequences of an urbanization process which was too quick and insufficiently controlled.",I

Sin embargo, en la franquicia, en general, y en la franquicia mexicana, en particular, las actividades orientadas a la gestión de marcas son poco investigadas. Si tenemos en cuenta que las franquicias tienen una participación importante en la economía y se presentan como una exitosa alternativa de crecimiento y expansión tanto en los mercados nacionales como en los internacionales, se hace necesario analizar, desde un enfoque de mercado, la influencia de la gestión de marca en la percepción del cliente. Este precisamente será el objetivo del presente trabajo el cual, tras justificarlo teóricamente, lleva a cabo un estudio empírico donde se aplica el sistema de ecuaciones estructurales a la información recogida a través de encuestas y entrevistas semiestructuradas de una muestra de franquiciados mexicanos con al menos cinco años de presencia en México, en las categorías de alimentos, bebidas y restaurantes. Los resultados obtenidos revelan la clara aseveración de que el componente interno de la gestión de marca es determinante en la percepción del cliente, es decir, tiene un efecto en el mercado. Pese a ello, también se aprecia el desconocimiento de los esfuerzos internos que más influyen en una imagen positiva de la marca que tiene el consumidor.",M

"José Manuel Brotons Martínez","La maximización del beneficio en las empresas depuradoras de aguas residuales. El caso de Valencia (España)","El estudio propone un sistema de maximización de beneficios de una estación depuradora de aguas residuales (EDAR). La presencia de objetivos múltiples impide su consecución simultánea, por lo que se considerará suficiente la consecución de un determinado grado de satisfacción para cada uno de ellos. En ocasiones, resulta muy complicado este último planteamiento, por lo que se permitirán excepcionalmente ciertas violaciones de algunas restricciones, lo que permite concluir que la programación por objetivos borrosa puede ser un instrumento adecuado para este tipo de problemas. En consecuencia, las EDAR tendrán una herramienta precisa para conseguir la maximización de sus beneficios al que se añade un nuevo sistema de medición de la eficiencia en el sector.",M

This paper contends that wealth is in fact related to happiness. More specifically, it is proposed that poverty as well as other adverse situations has an undermining effect on happiness, and that this effect is attenuated by a collectivist orientation. Analyses of variance (ANOVAs) using data on happiness, wealth and culture from 197 countries, supplemented by a meta-analysis of empirical studies that explore the relationship between wealth and perceptions of happiness, support the hypothesized relationship between adversity and happiness, and the moderating effect that collectivism has on such relationship.",M

Rol de la percepción de beneficios","El objetivo de este estudio es probar si el beneficio simbólico obtenido por el turista es consecuencia del beneficio hedónico y funcional otorgado por el lugar; y probar si el destino turístico le es más familiar al turista a medida que mejora la percepción del beneficio simbólico obtenido en él. A través de un análisis factorial confirmatorio, se identificaron diferentes escalas que permitieran medir dichas relaciones. Se utilizó un muestreo no probabilístico por cuotas, en proporción a destinos turísticos visitados en Chile, seleccionándose una muestra de 750 turistas. Los resultados arrojaron evidencia que la familiaridad de un lugar está determinada por el beneficio simbólico, siendo este beneficio resultado de los beneficios hedónicos y funcionales obtenidos por el turista.",M

"Claudia Eugenia Toca Torres","Inteligencia colectiva: enfoque para el análisis de redes","La revisión de la literatura anglosajona producida durante los últimos 16 años sobre inteligencia colectiva y otras metaheurísticas permite la construcción del estado del arte de 3 de sus características: autoorganización, flexibilidad y robustez. Dicho recorrido teórico aporta a la comprensión de las posibilidades de aplicación de la inteligencia colectiva no solo en especies sino en niveles de vida superiores como comunidades y ecosistemas. Dado que en el largo plazo la flexibilidad y la robustez emergen de la autoorganización, se sugiere el estudio de los asuntos de esta última característica en redes empresariales (información, comunicación, liderazgo, potencial creativo, pertenencia, autonomía, acción colectiva, cooperación, interacción, libertad y diversidad), así como el análisis de redes soportado en grafos e indicadores.",M

It is argued that the theoretical contributions of Pache and Santos can be categorized under the dimension of utility, because they can enhance the potential to operationalize and test the model. However, the reflections made in this paper not only highlight the need to take into account other external and internal factors for the study of strategic responses, but also the integration of different linkages of the decision process with strategic responses to institutional demands.",M

For this purpose we suggest three parallel and complementary dimensions to delimit the conceptual spaces where these theories can be placed. Using this classification as an analytical lens we summarize the core arguments suggested by each of these complex systems approaches, regarding the ideas of emergence and new order. This analysis helps us to conclude that the three theories coincide in their interest for studying nonlinear complex systems, but diverge in the nature of the complex problems studied. Finally we analyze the consequences that recognizing the similarities and differences between these approaches have, when using them for the study and research of social and business organizations and their management.",M

This questionswhether western management accounting practice can be effective without taking into considerationthe local needs. This is a previously unresearched topic. The study is archival with semi structuredinterviews with founder members of the local Association and practitioners of management accounting.There is evidence of a gap between management accounting techniques used in the West andmanagement accounting practice in the East. The paper suggests several reasons for this gap. Themain reason is that the context is different. It follows therefore that the practices in the west wouldnot suit the requirements of a postcolonial developing country. The theory relates to the west whilethe practice relates to the east. This contributes to the debate whether western imperialism and theaccounting that was imposed is useful for the needs of the indigenous accounting community.

"Alvaro Augusto Campos Martinez|Pastor Enrique Quintero Carvajal|Alvaro Alberto Ramírez Hernández","Evolución y Estructura Económica y Social del Tolima 1980 - 2002","Durante los veintid&oacute;s a&ntilde;os transcurridos entre 1980 y 2002 sucedieron en el Tolima hechos de trascendental importancia, como la cat&aacute;strofe de Armero, acaecida en diciembre de 1985, donde murieron alrededor de 29.000 personas y se destruy&oacute; buena parte de la infraestructura de una de las zonas m&aacute;s pr&oacute;speras del departamento; sin embargo, a ra&iacute;z de este desafortunado suceso, se generaron las condiciones para que se produjeran grandes transformaciones en la econom&iacute;a regional, a partir de las exenciones tributarias y arancelarias que estableci&oacute; el Gobierno Nacional (Ley 44 de 1987), con el fin de incentivar la inversi&oacute;n productiva en la zona afectada directa o indirectamente por el desastre. Para Ibagu&eacute;, su inclusi&oacute;n como beneficiaria de tales disposiciones (Decreto 78 de 1988), signific&oacute; el inicio de un per&iacute;odo de modernizaci&oacute;n y crecimiento, tanto urban&iacute;stico como econ&oacute;mico, a partir de la creaci&oacute;n de grandes y peque&ntilde;as empresas industriales, comerciales y de servicios, que buscaban beneficiarse de las ventajas tributarias. Sin embargo, buena parte de dichas empresas comenzaron a trasladarse a otras zonas, una vez terminado el plazo de diez a&ntilde;os, posteriores a su instalaci&oacute;n o inicio de la etapa productiva, establecido para obtener las prerrogativas. Desafortunadamente, el cierre o reubicaci&oacute;n de estas empresas en los &uacute;ltimos a&ntilde;os de la d&eacute;cada de los noventa, coincidi&oacute; con la mayor crisis econ&oacute;mica experimentada por el pa&iacute;s en su historia reciente, la cual tuvo un impacto mayor en la regi&oacute;n, pues mientras que el PIB nacional cay&oacute; 4.3% en 1999, en el departamento el descenso fue del 5.7%, y la recuperaci&oacute;n del a&ntilde;o siguiente, cuando el producto aument&oacute; 3.1% en el pa&iacute;s, fue muy parca en el Tolima, al producirse una variaci&oacute;n de solo 0.9%. Estos hechos sentaron las bases para el deterioro de algunos indicadores en los primeros a&ntilde;os del nuevo milenio, tal como ocurri&oacute; con el desempleo y el subempleo, que colocaron a Ibagu&eacute; en el primer lugar al registrar las mayores tasas de las trece ciudades encuestadas por el DANE, con lo cual se inici&oacute; un proceso de deterioro de la situaci&oacute;n econ&oacute;mica y social de nuestra regi&oacute;n, del que solo estamos comenzando a salir en el 2003, con el repunte de la construcci&oacute;n y la inversi&oacute;n en sociedades, as&iacute; como de las exportaciones de textiles y confecciones en virtud de las preferencias arancelarias contempladas en el ATPDEA.",R

Se utilizaron entrevistas semiestructuradas y análisis ideológico de la estructura textual de noticias en periódicos institucionales. Los resultados evidencian una contradicción entre el discurso teórico y el práctico que dan soporte a la enseñanza del emprendimiento. El primero profesa un discurso inclusivo, fundamentado en la igualdad social y de oportunidad para todos; el segundo evidencia un discurso basado en la exclusión, con utilización de estrategias y dispositivos discursivos que identifican posturas ideológicas como miembros de un grupo social específico.

The information was gathered with the use of semistructured interviews and ideological analysis of the news textual structure in institutional newspapers. The results evidence internal contradictions between the theoretical and practical discourse that support the teaching of entrepreneurship in each institution. The theoretical discourse professes an inclusive discourse based on social equality and opportunities for everyone; whereas the practical discourse evidences a discourse based on exclusion through the use of certain strategies and discursive  devices that identify ideological stances as group members of a specific social group.

"Mauricio Cabrera Galvis","Interrogantes sobre la iniciativa Brady y el futuro de la crisis de la deuda externa","No es posible pagar la totalidad de la deuda externa latinoamericana. Esta afirmación hoy parece ser un consenso general reconocido y aceptado por el mismo secretario del tesoro de los Estados Unidos. Más aún, la iniciativa Brady es ante todo un intento de generar un nuevo ordenamiento institucional, un arreglo entre acreedores y deudores, que permita hacer frente a esta realidad incuestionable de manera tal que se preserve el consenso y se evite una ruptura en el sistema monetario y financiero internacional.   El hecho real que da origen al planteamiento del secretario Brady es la existencia y consolidación de un amplio mercado secundario de deuda externa de los países en desarrollo, donde las transacciones se realizan con significativos descuentos. La iniciativa Brady no trata de dar legitimidad a unos precios específicos del mercado secundario, sino al hecho mismo de la existencia de un descuento en el valor de la deuda externa de los países en desarrollo. Es ampliamente conocido que el llamado mercado secundario de la deuda, es una especie de bazar en el que cada transacción es diferente y depende de las necesidades particulares del comprador y el vendedor y de sus respectivos poderes de negociación.   Las propuestas de reducción de la deuda y de su servicio son consecuencia lógica de la forma cómo ha evolucionado la crisis de la deuda externa desde sus orígenes en la cesación de pagos de México en 1982.    No obstante el reconocimiento explícito del secretario Brady de la realidad del descuento del mercado secundario de la deuda latinoamericana, y de la imposibilidad de que sea pagada en su totalidad, es largo todavía el camino que queda para recorrer antes de que estos planteamientos se conviertan en una realidad para todos los países.",F
"Leonardo Villar","Nuevas tendencias en el endeudamiento externo colombiano","Varios análisis sobre el endeudamiento externo colombiano realizados hacia fines de la década de los setenta coincidieron en mostrar unos indicadores excepcionalmente halagadores para el país. Adicionalmente, las tendencias observadas durante los últimos años se unen a varios elementos que otorgan al tema de la deuda una relevancia dentro de las discusiones públicas.   En primer lugar, los cambios en la composición y en las características de la deuda externa se suman a las altas tasas de interés internacionales para hacerla cada vez más costosa.   En segundo lugar, la observación de un creciente déficit en la cuenta corriente de la balanza de pagos, generado fundamentalmente por el mal desempeño de las exportaciones de bienes y servicios, plantea la necesidad inmediata de financiarlo para evitar una caída exageradamente rápida en las reservas internacionales del país.   En tercer lugar, la fuerte contracción en la liquidez internacional se ha unido a la crisis de pagos de muchos países de América Latina.   Teniendo en cuenta estos elementos que han contribuido a dar un gran realce a la discusión sobre el problema de la deuda externa colombiana, el presente informe tiene por objeto mostrar algunos de los principales indicadores relacionados con esa deuda entre 1970 y 1982. No se pretende de realizar un análisis detallado de los determinantes del endeudamiento público o privado en Colombia mucho menos una evaluación a profundidad de su importancia en el desarrollo económico nacional.

"Martín Uribe|Stephanie Schmitt-Grohé","Adjustment to small, large, and sunspot shocks in open economies with stock collateral constraints","This paper characterizes analytically the adjustment of an open economy with a stock collateral constraint to fundamental and nonfundamental shocks. In the model, external borrowing is limited by the value of physical capital. Three results are established: (1) Adjustment to external shocks is nonlinear. In response to small negative output shocks, the economy adjusts as prescribed by the intertemporal approach to the current account, with increases in debt, deficits in the trade and current account balances, and no significant movement in the price of collateral. By contrast, in response to large negative output shocks the economy experiences a sudden stop with debt deleveraging, trade and current account reversals, and a Fisherian deflation of asset prices. (2) Generically, weak fundamentals (low output and high external debt) give rise to multiple equilibria. (3) In this case, the economy is prone to self-fulfilling sudden stops driven by downward revisions of expectations about the value of collateral.    ******        Este artículo caracteriza de manera analítica el ajuste de una economía abierta con restricciones sobre el colateral a choques fundamentales y no fundamentales. En el modelo, el endeudamiento externo está limitado por el valor del capital físico. Se establecen tres resultados: (1) El ajuste a los choques externos es no lineal. En respuesta a choques de producción negativos pequeños, la economía se ajusta según lo dictado por el enfoque intertemporal de la cuenta corriente, con incrementos en la deuda, los déficits en la balanza comercial y de cuenta corriente, y sin movimientos significativos en el precio del colateral. Al contrario, en respuesta a los choques de producción negativos grandes la economía experimenta una parada súbita en los flujos de capitales con reducción del apalancamiento de la deuda, reversión de la balanza comercial y de cuenta corriente, y una deflación de Fisher de los precios de los activos. (2) En líneas generales, unos fundamentales débiles (baja producción y deuda externa alta) dan lugar a equilibrios múltiples. (3) En este caso, la economía es susceptible de paradas súbitas autocumplidas impulsadas por las revisiones a la baja de las expectativas acerca del valor del colateral.",F

"Junior Davis","Rural non-farm livelihoods in transition economies: emerging issues and policies","This article reviews key conceptual issues related to the development of the rural non-farm economy (RNFE) in a transition context and analyses available empirical evidence on the role of RNFE during recovery from the transition recession. Growth in the RNFE in the transition countries took place during the recession transition, which shows that it may be distress driven, but the paper explores other factors which may be driving the RNFE. It looks at the RNFE in light of the factors driving income growth and inequality, i.e. endowments and institutions. It concludes that, although not uniform across transition countries, the RNFE should be seen as a component of a growth strategy rather than as a temporary refuge or survival one. The patterns of growth of the RNFE will closely follow those of general economic recovery as well as the developments in the agricultural sector itself.",R
"Charles H.

Using dynamic panel regressions run on a comprehensive dataset of contemporary warfare which covers 22 years (1989-2010), I find that warring actors, both sovereign states and formally organized armed groups, behave systematically in terms of civilian targeting when they are involved in prolonged armed conflict (15-22 years). Warring actorsâ lethal behavior against civilians tends to be intensified if targeting is repeated in prolonged armed conflict although this hysteresis effect persists only for one year. It is hypothesized that the mounting war cost of prolonged conflict inclines warring groups toward the presumably cheaper targeting of noncombatant civilians rather than battling combatant military or other armed personnel.",F

Major findings include: Indias outward FDI is hardly affected by motives to access raw materials or superior technologies. Market-related factors appear to have dominated the location choices of Indian direct investors. A larger Indian diaspora in the host countries attracts more FDI. Finally, it seems that Indian direct investors are relatively resilient to weak institutions and economic instability in the host countries. However, we do not find robust evidence that India provides an alternative source of FDI for countries that traditional investors tend to avoid",F

We perform Logit and Poisson Pseudo Maximum Likelihood estimations drawing on UNCTADs database on bilateral FDI flows, including various emerging and developing countries as sources of FDI outflows. We find that economic geography variables are more relevant for FDI from non-traditional sources, while non-traditional investors appear to be as risk adverse as traditional investors.

One hypothesis is that foreign multinationals are less linked into the Irish economy, so more likely to leave once the economy is hit by a negative shock. The paper discusses background hypotheses before giving empirical evidence from firstly aggregate data, and secondly firm-level observations. The analysis of the latter suggests that foreign firms are not more likely to leave during the crisis than Irish firms. Some policy conclusions are offered in the paper",F

Quite uniquely, we also evaluate the importance of support received by the domestic firm, either from the government or the multinational business partner, for this link. Overall, our data analysis shows that for the average domestic firm, supplying to a foreign multinational in the country (the backward linkage) is positively associated with product innovation. Buying from a multinational (the forward linkage) is positively associated with labor productivity. These results are independent of any type of support from the government or multinationals. We also find that domestic firms process innovation activity is only positively associated with supplying a multinational if the firm also receives assistance from the government or multinational. Furthermore, we find that supplying a multinational is only positively associated with domestic firms productivity if the firm received technology transfer from the multinational customers",F

Our results question the impression that all is well with education in East Asia. First, we find that the cognitive achievement of pupils did not change substantially in 1980Â94 (except for the Philippines, where it most likely declined). Hence schooling output largely remained flat or worsened. Second, we find that the relative price of schooling increased by more than would be warranted by zero productivity growth in schooling. Therefore, we conclude that schooling productivity has declined. The main reason for the fading productivity of schooling appears to be a decline in the pupil-teacher ratio.",I

The key finding is that TFP growth mandated an increase in the unskilled wage, relative to the remuneration of human capital, during the 1970s, but a decrease during the 1980s. This is consistent with the observation that, in most sample countries, the relative wage and employment opportunities of low-skilled workers tended to improve until about 1980, but have deteriorated since then. While the regression results suggest that technological change played a large role in shifting labour demand against low-skilled workers, this conclusion is qualified because the empirical evidence is also compatible with product upgrading and outsourcing of low-skill intensive production activities to low-income countries.",F

We employ Probit and Tobit models and test for significant differences in the distribution of aid by new and old donors across recipient countries.

It turns out that German NGOs are more active in poorer countries, while they do not complement official aid by working under difficult local conditions. Beyond a certain threshold, rising financial dependence weakens their poverty orientation and provides an incentive to engage in easier environments. In addition, we find that the NGOs follow the state as well as NGO peers when allocating aid. This herding behavior is, however, hardly affected by the degree of public refinancing",F

The rhetoric of donors suggests that this insight has increasingly shaped the allocation of aid. However, we find little evidence supporting the view that the targeting of aid has improved significantly. Most donors provide higher aid to relatively poor countries, but so far the fight against poverty has not resulted in a stronger focus on recipient countries with particularly high incidence of absolute poverty. Many donors failed to direct aid predominantly to where local conditions were conducive to a productive use of inflows. The response of donors to changing institutional and policy conditions in recipient countries turns out to be fairly weak.

In particular, we assess whether repercussions at home depend on the size, location and type of outward FDI. We control for firm heterogeneity and estimate ordered probit models with the firms own assessment of domestic production and employment effects as dependent variables. We find that the probability of negative effects increases slightly with the size of FDI. The effects of locating in China differ from those of locating in advanced countries not only in size but also in sign.

Our findings strongly underscore the need for a disaggregated analysis of aid allocation. Aid channels differ significantly in the extent to which need and merit are taken into account.

However, the incentives of NGOs to excel and target aid to the poor and deserving are increasingly disputed. We contribute to the emerging literature on the allocation of NGO aid by performing panel Tobit estimations for Swiss NGOs. The analysis offers new insights in two major regards: First, we cover the allocation of both self-financed and officially co-financed aid for a large panel of NGOs and recipient countries. Second, by classifying each NGO according to its financing structure, we address the unresolved question of whether financial dependence on the government impairs the targeting of NGO aid. It turns out that NGOs mimic the state as well as NGO peers. Officially refinanced NGOs are more inclined to imitate the allocation of ODA. However, the degree of financial dependence does not affect the poverty orientation of NGO aid and the incentives of NGOs to engage in easier environments. The allocation of self-financed aid differs in several respects from the allocation of officially co-financed aid, including the role of financial dependence for imitating the state and herding among NGOs",F

We hypothesise that the potential for spillovers is related to observable characteristics of the production process of foreign affiliates, and evaluate this empirically. We further explore the role of competition in explaining productivity spillovers within industries. Our empirical analysis yields a number of important findings. First, we show that the potential for spillovers is importantly related to the production technology of the sectors and foreign affiliates. Firms that relocate labour-intensive activities to Hungary to exploit differences in labour costs are unlikely to generate productivity spillovers, while spillovers increase in the capital intensity of foreign affiliates. Second, we find that spillovers differ markedly in the early and later stages of transition, and that there are differences between small and large firms. Furthermore, foreign presence tends to affect the productivity of domestic firms negatively whenever MNEs produce for the domestic market",F

First, capital markets in general and banking markets in particular show a greater degree of segmentation than national financial markets as a result of information costs and regulatory barriers to full integration. Second, financial market structures differ among the members of Euroland, which potentially affects the transmission of (monetary) shocks. This paper provides a simple model of a currency union which takes these peculiarities into account, focusing on the interaction of financial structures, the degree of capital mobility, the transmission of shocks, and the portfolio choices of banks.",F

While the conventional within-country cross-section evidence remains controversial, recent contributions which control for potential resource endogeneity suggest that returns to resource usage in education are decreasing. Resources may render positive effects at very low endowment levels prevailing in many developing countries, but their effect is weak to non-existent in advanced countries. The missing resource-performance link in education also shows up in international cross-section evidence and in within-country time-series evidence.",I

First, poor developing countries need to be attractive to foreign investors. Second, the host-country environment in which foreign investors operate must be conducive to favourable FDI effects with regard to overall investment, economic spillovers and income growth. This paper argues that it is much more difficult to benefit from FDI than to attract FDI. Weak markets and institutions typically prevailing in poor countries tend to seriously constrain the growth-enhancing and povertyalleviating effects of FDI. The crux is that creating an environment in which FDI may deliver social returns will take considerable time exactly where development needs are most pressing.",F

We show that surprisingly little has changed since the late 1980s. Traditional market-related determinants are still dominant factors. Among non-traditional FDI determinants, only the availability of local skills has clearly gained importance. As concerns the interface between trade policy and FDI, we find that the tariff jumping motive for FDI had lost much of its relevance well before globalization became a hotly debated issue.",F

However, the World Bank's success story rests on an extremely weak foundation: First, the institution's contribution to financial rescue packages for some emerging markets, rather than poverty concerns and policy assessments, dominated the distribution of World Bank financing. Second, the picture portrayed in the report takes a bad turn if only two outliers with extremely high per capita aid (Cape Verde and Honduras) are excluded from the sample. Third, according to our regression results, the allocation of World Bank aid did not improve in the course of the 1990s.",F

Using the random part of the class-size variation between two adjacent grades within individual schools allows us to identify causal class-size effects. Conventional estimates of class-size effects are shown to be severely biased in most school systems by within- and between-school sorting of students. Differences in our estimates across countries suggest that it is misleading to generalize results from one school system to others. While we find sizable beneficial effects of smaller classes in Greece and Iceland, the possibility of even small effects is rejected in Japan and Singapore. In 11 countries, we rule out large class-size effects. The existence of class-size effects, and the lack thereof, in different school systems appears to be related to the relative quality of the teaching force.",I

We argue that fragmented donor-recipient relationships, notably the large number of minor aid relations that tend to be associated with donors desire to have fly their flag around the world, increase aid unpredictability. Our empirical analysis of the determinants of aid unpredictability suggests that aid becomes less predictable with more fragmented donor-recipient relationships. Specifically, the effect of fragmentation on overshooting previous spending plans is statistically highly significant and substantively important. In contrast, fragmented donor-recipient relationships have no effect on the shortfall of actual aid compared to donors spending plans",F

Evidence from International Data","Pecking order models of international finance suggest that countries should become less reliant on international bank lending as they develop. Reduced information costs are one of the factors behind this trend towards disintermediation. This paper presents a simple model on the choice between bank debt and bond finance which builds on Rajan (1992), and it uses two new datasets to test the implications, focusing on bilateral cross-border bank claims and bond holdings. We find support for the hypothesis that the state of development of an economy lowers the share of bank finance. However, evidence on the importance of variables which more directly measure information costs is less clear-cut.",F

Both total trade data as well as US import trade figures do not support this perception. Success episodes such as the recent increase in Indian computer and data processing services are found to be outliers. Instead, developing countries continue to rely on relatively slowly growing exports of relatively labour-abundant consumer services relating to movements of goods and persons. Thus, they have not yet benefited from innovations in the information technology sectors providing a growth momentum for producer services. Given the link between goods production and goods distribution, successful exporters of manufactures mostly overlap with successful exporters of services. It is shown that the majority of exemptions from MFN treatment concentrate on such consumer services thus impeding developing countriesÂ export growth. In view of the vague character of commitments negotiated in the General Agreement on Trade in Services, the paper argues that for the time being overproportionate growth of service exports from developing countries will remain limited to country episodes, but will not have the same wide country coverage as growth of manufactured exports.",F

The main conclusion is that the benefits from WTO membership in terms of improved market access for traditional exports are likely to be limited. However, by submitting a wide range of trade-related policies to international scrutiny and by entering into binding commitments on the conduct of these policies, reform-oriented governments in vulnerable economies can make it more likely that their reforms will be successful.",F

A microeconometric student-level estimation based on data for more than 260,000 students from 39 countries reveals that positive effects on student performance stem from centralized examinations and control mechanisms, school autonomy in personnel and process decisions, competition from private educational institutions, scrutiny of achievement, and teacher influence on teaching methods. A large influence of teacher unions on curriculum scope has negative effects on student performance. The findings imply that international differences in student performance are not caused by differences in schooling resources but are mainly due to differences in educational institutions.",I

Controlling for national and international knowledge spillovers we argue that effects of FDI work through direct compositional effects as well as changing competition in the host country. Our results show that there are, on average, productivity benefits from inward FDI, although we can identify a number of countries which, on aggregate, do not appear to benefit in terms of productivity. On the other hand, a countrys stock of outward FDI is, on average, negatively related to productivity. However, again there is substantial heterogeneity in the effect across OECD countries",F

Based on a representative dataset for 61 important NGOs from various OECD countries, we analyze the targeting of NGO aid across a large number of recipient countries by jointly considering major determinants of NGO aid in a multivariate regression framework. While our results show that NGOs are more active in the neediest countries, we reject the hypothesis that NGOs complement official aid through engaging in so-called difficult institutional environments. Rather, they tend to replicate the location choices of official backdonors. Moreover, NGOs follow other NGOs so that aid gets clustered. Finally, NGOs select recipient countries with common traits related to religion or colonial history. Taken together, our findings suggest that NGOs keep a low profile rather than distinguishing themselves from other donors and trying to excel under risky conditions",F

Comparing the Allocation of Swiss Aid by Private and Official Donors","Being closer to the poor, NGOs are widely believed to provide better targeted aid than state agencies. But empirical evidence is largely lacking. We contribute to closing this gap by drawing on an exceptionally detailed Swiss database that covers different forms of NGO aid and several official aid benchmarks. The differentiated Tobit estimations account for both altruistic and selfish aid motivations. It turns out that it depends on the source of NGO funding as well as the choice of the official benchmark whether or not NGOs provide better targeted aid. In contrast to widespread belief, however, the allocation of self-financed NGO aid reveals striking similarities to the allocation of official Swiss development aid.",F

In this paper, we employ geocoded aid data from Uganda to assess whether the countrys donors have increasingly specialized and better coordinated their aid activities at the district and sector level. Our findings point in the opposite direction: over the period 2006-2013, aid of most major donors in Uganda became more fragmented, and the duplication of aid efforts increased. There is tentative evidence that donors were more active in poorer parts of the country, which would provide some justification for clustered aid activities",F

We establish a unique data set by combining data from the World Bank Enterprise Surveys that allow us to distinguish between foreign investors from sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa. We find strong evidence of horizontal productivity spillovers to domestic firms derived from foreign-firm presence. However, these effects are clearly dependent on domestic firms absorptive capacity. The largest productivity effects seem to be driven by investors from sub-Saharan Africa. Our analysis also shows that productivity effects differ according to the income level of host countries. Overall, the strongest productivity effects seem to materialize in lower-middle-income countries. These key findings emphasize the increasing importance of emerging investors, beyond the traditional players from industrialized countries, in sub-Saharan Africa",F

Issues related to labor quality have also been documented and analyzed. We observe that employment grew at 2.1 percent per year during 1980-1993 but it fell to 1.6 percent during 1994-2002 and further to just 1 percent during 2003-2011. The growth in persons employed during the entire period of study, 1980-2011 is led by construction and the services sector, possibly due to less labor regulations, followed by the secondary sector-consisting of manufacturing, electricity; gas and water supply and then agriculture. There has been a structural shift of employment from agriculture to construction and services, especially market-based services. The plausible reasons for slow growth in employment have been low labor force participation rates, especially by females, low labor intensity, and use of high capital intensive technology in production. The quality of labor in India is characterized by the poor among the employed, low share of persons employed with skills (employed persons with education level above higher secondary was only 10.2% in 2011 in the total economy), low growth rate in educational attainments, high proportion of persons employed as casual labor and a very high share of unorganized sector employment. Though the Indian economy is supposed to enjoy the fruits of demographic dividend and achieve high growth rates but the recent trend of falling employment elasticity (just 0.07 during 2003-2011) paints a very disappointing employment scenario. Even the sustainability of the service sector to provide jobs in future is in doubt because of its falling employment elasticity in recent years.",I
